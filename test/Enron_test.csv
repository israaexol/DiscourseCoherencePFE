"1144932","Asset Dispositions--""Success Fees""","Mark and Jeff: There is an impression circulating among some of the commercial teams that their compensation may be directly linked to asset dispositions, ie. success fees.  Apparently, this may have started due to ""rumors"" that the London Receiver is allowing for such payments--for example, the pending Arcos turbine sale.  This is unsubstantiated, but may be worthy of inquiry.  Accordingly, in at least one domestic example, it is my understanding that the deal team was fairly unmotivated until they heard about the London ""arrangement"" and are now pursuing with great exuberance.  Maybe this is a good thing, but clearly an arrangement that needs to be vetted and then communicated so people understand what the ""rules"" may be.

Let me know how I may assist in addressing this.

In an effort to keep things consistent at UBS we have tried to perfect a roll spreadsheet that all regions should use.  We added extra rolls so we should never have to add rolls.  We have saved copies for our new P&L's in O:erms\erms_adm\netco\2002\0102\Regions0102 (this will be out new regions file until further notice.

Can you copy one of those files and use that as your new P&L's?  Let me know if you see a problem in doing that.  We are trying to start linking up all new P&L's to the DPR, can you save yours out to that file when you are ready.

"1303171","College Football Pool","We are putting together a college football pool that will run every week as well as keep an ongoing cumulative score.  The tentative plan is to have it be $100/man paid upfront with weekly payouts of 50% of the pot for the high score and rolling the other 50% of the pot into the cumulative total which pays out 3 places for the whole season (Sep 1 - Nov 24).  You will pick 5 games per week assigning each game a priority of 1-5.  All games will have the line as set by the friday edition of the U.S. Today.  The scoring will then be based on the priority values, e.g. If my 5, 3, and 2 priority games win I score 10 points for the week.   The weekly payout will be 100% to 1st place unless there is a tie, the total difference between your scores and the lines for all 5 games will be used to decide the winner.  The cumulative payout will be 50% for 1st, 30% for 2nd, and 20% for 3rd, of the remaining pot.

We are hoping to get at least 20 people which would be like $75/week and have $1000 left in the pot at the end for the cumulative leaders.  If you are interested let me know asap and also, invite whoever else you can think of, the more the better and we can maybe get the weekly payout to be more than the $100 entry fee.","3","2","3","3","2","3","3","2","2","3"
"894625","Bengalla Biz","We seem to be going round in circle's here and hence hopefully all the relevant people are now on copy of this e-mail so we can resolve swiftly. This cargo is due to be shipped in seven days with the coal already being railed to port. It is coal which will be shipped to service European commitments and represents the cheapest way to do so taking all costs into account (including financing). Needless to say if we pull out of this deal at this stage it will have huge ramifications with our customer and send all the wrong signals to our counterparties in this part of the world. Last but not least we will need to look elsewhere to procure coal for these European sales at what is likely to be a higher price.

Appreciate the green light.

"1251040","New Contract System - Impact on One-part/Two-part Indicator","Please be advised that we successfully converted existing data and implemented the new contract/capacity release system for Transwestern last week.  With that, there is one change that will impact the Commercial group.  In the old CBS system, the Contract Admin group was responsible for identifying whether a contract was negotiated as a one-part or two-part rate.  Until a deal sheet is built and the new rates/revenue system is implemented, the Marketers will continue to update discounts in the existing CBS system under Negotiated Rates Maintenance.

Additionally, the Marketer will be responsible for updating within the same rate maintenance screen the one-part/two-part flag for all new firm contracts under the 'reservation' charge code.  If a contract amendment requires a change to this indicator, this must also be captured; however, be advised that this field does not have effective dates.  Therefore, if the indicator is not applicable until a future date, the one-part/two-part flag cannot be updated because the current billing will pick up this change.  I will provide any additional training if necessary regarding the loading of rates/indicators.  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

As a reminder, we have scheduled internal demos of the new system today at 1:30pm and 3pm as well as this Thursday at 1:30pm in EB3907.","3","3","3","3","3","3","2","2","3","3"

"682836","Conference Call Today with FERC Staff","A conference call was held today with FERC staffers to discuss items of interest or concern to us.  Participating for FERC were Bob Pease (enforcement att'y), Stuart Fisher (economist) and Bruce Poole (engineer).  Alan Comnes, Dave Perrino and I weighed in for Enron.  The laundry list of topics discussed is attached.  We expressed the sentiment that the root cause of all these issues and concerns is the current composition (and non-independence) of the ISO board, and suggested that the ISO board situation should be the subject of the upcoming FERC audit of ISO.  We went on to discuss the audit further and the fact that there is no established or formal comment process.  However, we were invited to file written comments with the Commission on what we thought should be audited, and Alan is taking the lead on this.  We will try to get others to sign on to the comments.  Some of the discussion items that the staff was highly interested in included:

ISO request for a bid from us to prop up the price (staff requested a copy of the transcript).

Any unexplained decreases in ATC (staff asked to be advised in real time).

Information related to ISO OOM purchases (and whether they were declining).","3","1","2","2","2","3","2","2","2","2"

Paul Cherry's counterpart, Herb Truelove, called back to say that TW should not combine the gas sales with their firm transportation contracts and they should only provide security for their $130 thousand dollars worth of firm transportation.  We countered that regardless of whether the exposure is from transportation services, storage, imbalances work orders or gas sales, we include all potential exposure when  enforcing our global credit policy.

"1260886","Point to ponder......","One day, three men were hiking and unexpectedly came upon a large raging, violent river. They needed to get to the other side, but had no idea of how to do so. The first man prayed to God, saying, ""Please God, give me the strength to cross this river."" Poof! God gave him big arms and strong legs, and he was able to swim across the river in about two hours, after almost drowning a couple of times.

Seeing this, the second man prayed to God, saying, ""Please God, give me the strength ..and the tools to cross this river."" Poof! God gave him a rowboat and he was able to row across the river in about an hour, after almost capsizing the boat a couple of times.

The third man had seen how this worked out for the other two, so he also prayed to God saying, ""Please God, give me the strength and the tools...and the intelligence ... to cross this river."" And poof! God turned him into a woman. She looked at the map, hiked upstream a couple of hundred yards, then walked across the bridge.

"1311815","Team building event for my direct reports","Can you hold on this until after mid-week this week?  We haven't gotten much communication from ""above"" on spending, but everyone is doing the obvious things to be prudent right now.  I can tell you that even over this Thanksgiving weekend (with banks open on Friday), that there is still tremendous concern and focus on cash.  (I got calls at home on Friday afternoon to provide data on EA, EGM and EIM payables - data deemed critical that day).  I know that company-wide, we will want to be certain that the cancellation of the company-wide holiday party does not result in just as much money being spent by hundreds of groups across the company.

If  waiting until after mid-week makes the timing diffcult for planning purposes, I might suggest a less costly version.  One idea is to tell your directs that you want to bring them together as a group to thank them for their hard work and offer your home for the occassion on the 7th.  You could submit for expense reimbursement the cost of something like wine and beer, and ask everyone to bring a snack to contribute to the party.  I think that everyone would understand not having the entire event underwritten by Enron - especially following the events that will occur  this week.  Over the years we have all gotten used to Enron footing the bill for so many things.  At the bank where I was before, we occassionally had get-togethers where we all brought something to the party.  It is not really unusual outside Enron.  --Sally","3","2","2","3","2","3","2","3","2","3"

We are not receiving timely information from the Hub regarding our Park and Lend Agreement.  I have not received an update since Tues or Wed of last week.   Mike has been phoning them furiously for information and has been told that they don't have it, or it will be ready later.  Per GISB, final scheduled numbers on EPNG, NNG, and TW are reported at 9:00 am the following day (ie. Sunday final will be out at 9 AM on Mon.).  Prior to the transition from PG&E, we received our balance by 9:15 or 9:30 AM.  I realize that the transition has been difficult, they are never a cake walk, however, this type of information is crucial.  Further, they have not provided any final numbers for the month of April, we should at least be able to receive a ""best available"" number, and the Interstate Pipes, due to GISB, have final scheduled numbers available on the first of the month.  I submit that ENA should not be held liable for payment of the $0.03/day rate, as we have not received the information we need to balance the agreement.  If EPGT plans to administer fees, then balance information should be communicated on a timely basis.  We may want to check the terms of the agreement, and/or negotiate a reduced rate for the month of May.

"743563","Texas Comission supports prompt implementation of SPP","SPP is joining MISO and today MISO said that the merger should be filed at FERC 1Q02.  MISO also told FERC that the same congestion management systems would be used in SPP/MISO, so no seams.  Since MISO is moving toward the market design we want, then really it seems that SPP should be implementing the MISO system for Day1 (which may well be up 12/15/01) and should be right in line with MISO on Day 2 issues (that we like).

However, FERC should not approve SPP as an RTO until it is in with MISO.  I don't see that FERC needs to approve SPP as an RTO in order to allow SPP to finish work on a wholesale energy system because presumably SPP will be using MISO's system.  This summer FERC told SPP to not spend more $ since it was not an RTO yet and it was going off on its own merry way.  Therefore, FERC could say ""use MISO's system and specify exactly the minimum that needs to be done on systems in order to have the TX retail settlements done.  This should be done consistent with the no seams, as represented by MISO.""  That should satisfy Texas PUC concerns.","3","2","1","2","2","3","2","1","2","2"

"59454","Call to Bob Glynn","Per our discussion this morning, below is a summary of items to discuss with Glynn:

Adding Enron's ""negative CTC claim"" to the list of claims: PGE's filing included a list of top twenty creditors.  Our negative CTC claim was apparently not taken into account in compiling that list.  The list is nonbinding, however.  PG&E will be required to file schedules of creditors on April 20.  Our negative CTC claim should be on Schedule F (for unsecured claims).  You may want to remind Glynn of your previous conversations and state our expectation that the negative CTC claim will appear (preferably as uncontested) in the April 20 filing. (Note: if PG&E does not include the claim we have an opportunity to file a proof of claim and ultimately the court determines the validity of the claim).

Including Enron on the Creditors' Committee:  PG&E may have the opportunity to influence representation on the creditors' committees.  There are several reasons to suggest to Glynn that we be included: 1) we are a big creditor, 2) we could be helpful in crafting a broader solution, and 3) we are one of the real parties in interest behind the PX and ISO (who were listed as significant creditors but are really just ""passthroughs"" for the suppliers ... and PG&E likely would not want to have those political bodies serving on the creditors committee anyway).","2","2","2","2","2","3","2","2","2","2"

"1256360","Firing of Nolan Richardson","What an absolute embarrassment this decision is for the entire state of Arkansas and your University.  I lived in Fayetteville for many years as a child while my mother got her PhD from the University of Arkansas.  We were avid fans of the sports programs, especially basketball.  I remember as a child watching Sidney Moncrief at the old arena with my mom.  I remember stories she always told about teaching Dan Hampton as a graduate assistant.  I also remember how beautiful the landscape was in Fayetteville.  Unfortunately all of those memories are now tarnished because of the recent decisions made by you and Chancellor White.  This decision is a slap in the face to all decent Americans.  Your decision was probably based on recent tirades made by arguably the most successful coach in any sport at your University.  Coach Richardson had a phenomenal record and had gone to the tournament 15 out of 16 seasons.  I remember the awful way he was treated when he first got to Arkansas while his daughter was dying of leukemia.  I was embarrased then, but I am even more embarrased now to say that I ever called Arkansas home.  You and I will never know what it is like to walk a mile in a minorities shoes, and I think you should have cut the man some slack.  Can you not be embarrassed with what also happened at his farm last week?  You have probably done irrepairable harm to all of your athletic programs.  Arkansas already has a checkered past when it comes to minorities and this is yet another misstep in that disturbing past.

Many of you know someone who wouldn't be here without these advancements in medical technology.

On Saturday, November 3, Enron and other companies will be joining the American Heart Association for the Heart Walk.  The Houston Heart Walk is targeting over $750,000 for continuing the fight against heart disease and for rebuilding the many years of research that were lost as a result of this year's floods.

We are looking for 50 team captains.  The primary role of a team captain is to recruit approximately ten walkers.  The walkers can be friends, family, business associates outside Enron, or co-workers.  The walkers, in turn, solicit sponsors for the walk.  As a team captain, you may also walk, of course, and Enron's top walker (from a fundraising perspective) is eligible for two free airline tickets.

I have added in the option to fix language, but I am not sure it is necessary or desirable to have it.

"1267709","re- PLEASE READ- TO ALL TRAINED FIRE WARDENS","Hello.  This notice is being sent to all trained fire wardens I have listed at Enron Center North.  As you may know, each year the Houston Fire Department reviews every high rise building to make sure they are in compliance with the Houston city fire code.  As part of that process, it is required by law that Enron maintain accurate records of all trained fire wardens as well as keep an ongoing list of any persons with a mobility impairment who may require special assistance during a fire drill or evacuation.  A fire drill will occur at Enron on or before December 1st.  Therefore, as trained fire wardens on your respective floors, if you know of anyone who may require special assistance during an actual fire drill or building evacuation, please forward there names to me so that I may obtain their contact information to maintain on file.  The Houston Fire Department is subject to fine Enron between $250 and $2000 for every daily violation that occurs if these records are not kept up to date.  Note, this information is strictly for use to have on file for the Houston Fire Department.  It will be kept confidential.  Thank you in advance for your assistance.

"59463","August Palo Verde","My latest information on rate increases in California indicates that they will be implemented June 1st.  That means that customers don't see a price signal until June and won't actually see their bill until July.  While I agree with Greg that we may see dramatic demand side response once people see their bills, we have no idea how long it will take people and businesses to adjust their behavior.  I don't really care what positions you guys want to carry.  My only advice is that Greg is short a fairly illiquid product.  If you want to get out right now you would have to pay, at least for some of your position, north of $800/MWh.  In the near term I don't think that it will be easy to get out of this trade.  In the long run, if the market comes off, it will be easy to get out.

Bottom line --

At the end of the day I think that you may be right, but things look very bullish right now.  I want to make sure that you know that you have already pushed the bounds of liquidity for that product and that you should not expect us to provide liquidity to you in a market that doesn't offer it to us when it is time to get out.","2","3","3","3","3","2","1","2","2","2"

"1355061","Montana Power Company (MPC) Energy Imbalance","Bill; Mike Cashell (MPC's Transmission Mgr.) just phoned me concerned, because MPC's Real-Time group requested EPMI purchase energy for them under our existing Energy Imbalance structure, and was notified by our Real-Time group that due to the newly implemented FERC price cap, we were have difficulty securing any resources.  Just to clarify things, we are settling MPC's Choice customers Energy Imbalance position, and PP&L Montana has the right to any length resulting from MPC's ""domestic"" load Energy Imbalance.  In other words MPC is settling two separate Energy Imbalance accounts, so during the hour they may be turning energy back to PP&L Montana, while at the same time finding themselves short for the Choice loads.  During the recent bullish pricing conditions, Choice customer were leaving themselves long, as of late, MPC is experiencing the Choice customers doing the opposite, positioning themselves short.  The net result is that MPC will most likely be expecting us to fill a short position from this point on, so I'd really like to see what we can do to honor their requests, mindful of the favorable position we've enjoyed over the last several months. Let me know if you'd like to discuss this further, or better yet if you've got a workable solution to the problem.

There are two games on the list that  have not been rescheduled yet but they are on the list to let you know that I  know that it needs to be done.

I don't  want to enforce the 24 hour rule, but some of you are waiting a week or  more.  After tomorrow, if you wait a week or more to call in a score you  will forfeit the game.  Please help me get this stuff done on time as we  come to the close of the season.  I am working hard to make it so we can  end on time, but I can't do it without some help.

"69650","Holiday Party - Canceled","I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.

If you are OK with this move, I would like Chris to spend part of his time next week downloading from Daren as I have him through next Friday.

On another matter, I believe Daren has E-mailed you about an agency agreement that we have with Cleburne Plant that needs to be transitioned to the estate.

"292035","Peerless Proposal as discussed on Thursday, May 17, 2001","I would like for us to take a look at charging Peerless some sort of number based on the market price for leased storage.  I talked to a guy in the Enron liquids group who said that 2-oil tankage in the Caribbean goes for about $0.25- $0.30 per barrel per month.  If we leased them only 150,000 bbls of capacity in the tank and kept the rest for ourselves, that would be around $40,000/month.  The actual number could be whatever we are comfortable with keeping in storage as minimums.  If we could get something out of it every month and still sell them our inventory that would be great.  But I would also like to know how it looks in case they wouldn't go for that and we had to hold title to whatever oil we already have in the tank. Then we could still have some sort of pricing mechanism for buying and selling oil to each other in the tank.

From what I heard from Peerless, they would plan to unload vessels into Eco's tank, then transfer out of that tank to their other tanks when needed.  Whatever the case would be, we would have to have controls on quality in our tank, and insist on seeing the analysis on everything before it goes into the tank.","2","2","3","3","2","3","2","2","1","2"

"1275972","good morning","I tried calling but noone picked up the phone.  Anyway, I just wanted to check and make sure you don't have any questions about running keystone and socal.  Generally, I put them out there initially with a 2 cent two way until the market gets moving a bit and then tighten keystone up to 1 or 1.5 cents.  All the products should be set to offset to last trade(usually a penny).  Then I just adjust the offset depending on how fast I think the market is moving.  The market tends to get really slow by 9:15, so by then, I'm back to a 2 cent two-way at keystone and a 3 cent two-way at the border.  These markets will still be tighter than ICE.  Also just a reminder, we have 8000 of the Waha gas to sell to the Texas desk.  All transport should be in position already.  Jason may talk to you about moving some of his transport out of Keystone, but not likely.  I would expect that we would probably want to go about 50,000 long for tuesday and then wednesday.

- It has come to my attention that some groups (back office) have been told that each individual within their group can elect to be part of the Estate or of NewCo. This is surprising to me. No such election has been offered to anyone in EnronOnline (nor do I think it would make sense to offer that), but before I tell people they do not have a choice, I wanted to check with you.  - ?

- On the issue of bonuses: The numbers we put together made sense to me in the context of an annual  bonus with some element of retention mixed in. According to the auctions documents I looked at, retention is identified as being for a 1 year period, with 1/2 of the amount paid up front and 1/2 one year later. If this is the case, it significantly changes the complexion (i.e. more like a retention payment with an element of bonus, rather than bonus with an element of retention) and we should revisit the numbers.

I told him that as he has time I could utilize him for analysis or other projects but not at the expense of his current job.  The bottom line is that Dave is very good at his current role and he has expressed interest in trading.  I viewed this move as an opportunity to evaluate his trading potential while he is given the opportunity to see what trading is really like;  but I have no immediate plans to move Dave into trading.  If the time ever comes that I would like bring him into trading I will certainly coordinate the transition with you.  I was under the impression that Dave cleared all this with you before he moved.

"1258079","TRPA Park Place Entertainment Deal","Operations approves this transaction with the following notations:

1)  This is an approval for this deal only, and should not be taken as a blanket approval of additional retail deals.  Any additional retail deal should be separately considered through the TRPA process.

2)  UBSW Energy's processes and systems are designed to handle wholesale commodity transactions.  This single transaction will not suport the cost of system enhancements or changes to accommodate a retail deal.  Therefore, certain operational functions will be handled manually, and as such, are subject to a potential human error rate and reconciliation process that comes with the manual manipulation of data.  The Operations team will put the necessary additional checks and balances in place to mitigate these risks, but it should be noted that the risk of data errors will be inherently increased as a result of manual processes for a one-off transaction.

3)  The Operations team currently has the capacity to service this one-off, manually intensive transaction due to unused capacity in place to service UBSW Energy wholesale business.  When the wholesale business is once again in full swing, it is possible that the current Operations resources will be insufficient to service both the wholesale business and this one retail deal.

"1111866","NERC Meeting Today","There was an all day meeting of the NERC/reliability legislation group today.  I will provide a more detailed report, but the group completed the process of reviewing the changes that some had suggested to shorten and streamline the NERC ""electric reliability organization"" legislation.  Sarah and I asked a series of questions and made comments on our key issues and concerns.  I want to give you a more complete report once I have gone back over the now ""final draft"" version.

The timing being imposed by NERC is that they will circulate a ""clean"" version of the proposal tomorrow or Monday.  They have asked for comments by next Thursday, August 16th, with an indication of whether each company/organization does or does not sign on to support it.  They will then transmit the proposal and the endorsement letter to Congress and the Administration so they have it as Hill and Energy Dept. staff work on electricity drafting issues this month.

I pointed out that EPSA is not due to meet internally with its members to discuss these issues until after the NERC deadline.  That is not deterring NERC from moving forward with the above time frame.","3","3","3","3","2","2","2","2","2","2"

"1135556","Water","I like it for 2 reasons:

1.    The dust has not yet settled on all of our ERCs for Roseville.  There are still fantasy issues that EPA and others are thinking about, which if implemented, will  make some of the ERC deals we have at best uneconomical.

2.    If we got this ""gift"", it would be nice to be able to sell the ERCs we have so that we can reduce our out of pocket exposure during these fun times.  Frankly, if Leslie's idea became law, these ERCs could be sold to projects who did not have access to the waste water that we do, thus facilitating additional new power plant devleopment for the benefit of the state.

Having said all of the above, I have my doubts that something like this would have a chance of working out.  The little people in the environmental community have absolutely no concept of the big picture, being instead more worried about detail process over global results.  I think that this thing would get bogged down in the reality that projects would get ERCs, but the net result would be a short term decrease in air quality in the local air basin due to not applying specific, coincident ERCs to specific projects.  The little people probably cannot get their head around that, even though the very clean modern plants one day would put out of business dirtier, less efficient plants, thus resulting in a net improvement in air quality in the state.","1","2","1","1","3","2","2","3","3","3"

Alan Comnes

Beginning at 2359 on December 12, 2001, the ISO will alter the way it  pays inter-tie bids for Energy.  Specifically, the ISO (1) will continue to pre-dispatch an inter-tie bid in merit order in the BEEP stack before the beginning of the operating hour but (2) now ensure such a bid is dispatched throughout the entire operating hour (i.e., never reversed), thus paying the bid the Instructed Energy Price for all ten-minute intervals in that hour.

Furthurmore, their involvement in Quinque could result in the development of evidence adverse to our position in the Grynberg case. What are your thoughts?","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","1","1"
"1282143","Market Based Rate (MBR) Position Piece for EPSA--Calll Notes and the Latest Draft","Looks good.  I agree that making arguments about merchant generation ""stranded costs"" is questionable, better to couch this as ""structural impact on market participants"".  More importantly, if I bought 50% of generation in one market, and FERC changes their rules, seems like I either (a) sell generation and take the loss or (b) get regulatory risk insurance.  FERC has the right to make markets work.

Finally, on the issue of blanket authority, I think that the CAISO model is a good example of why this may not work for Enron.  In the long-run, as a market-maker, Enron needs workable markets.  A good test case would have been this - under FERC's proposed rules, would FERC have granted market-wide waiver in California?  If FERC is comfortable with the result, than move ahead.

"58917","Still working on it but here's where we are","We can talk about it at 10:00am, however, I do not think the split will work as you propose. The vast majority of the industrial process load uses more than 25 MW on peak which is and should continue to be the focus of ENA. The target companies and sites we will focus on down here will  average somewhere in the 10-20 MW peak range(remember, non-process load, aggregation of sites).

After EES bought back the minority shareholders, there has been increasing overlap in the marketplace between EES/ENA. The reasoning behind deliniating where and how each group will focus was to alleviate the external overlap, reduce any friction between the groups, and increase both groups productivity.

I don't think there should be any issue on the Fertilizer companies, but I'll doublecheck.

Given our financial situation we did not do any fixed price physical transactions for December so we have no trades to report this month.  Hopefully our situation we be resolved soon so that we can be a part of the process in the near future.  For whatever it is worth, it that there are some unusual things happening in the ""Fixed Float"" markets in Texas particularily at HSC.  The NYMEX is down 10 cents today yet the HSC fixed float market went from plus 2 cents or $2.336 to $2.345 yesterday to now $2.36 with the Henry Hub also appearing to be inflated by maintaining a fixed float value of $2.31 again in a falling market.  We feel like we are defenseless because we have no trades to report and yet have basis and Gas Daily positions and some trade players know it so they are inflating the prices to hurt us more financially.  I have no evidence since I was not a participant in the fixed price physical market this month all I am asking is that you be extra vigilant in determining the validity of the transactions that are being submitted for index consideration.

I have to admit that i wasn't looking forward to it since i didn't know how she was going to act and if she was going to be bitchy.  About 15 minutes after we got there we passed on the way to the betting counter and she pulled me aside and was so very cool.  She kept asking are you o.k. and almost seemed to sympathize with me.  She said she didn't say anything to dax and would never say anything to him.  She was so cool about it i was totally shocked.  So on sunday dax calls and says they are going to bw3 so after a couple of hours we go up there to meet them.  I walk in and missy and don were there so i was a little surprised.    After we had been there for a while Z, laura, devon, and michelle go to play darts leaving me and missy at the table.  So starts saying so you aren't going to email me anymore and acting all sad.  Then she said i didn't have any balls.  Later don is talking about the heisman and what the statue looks like and she looks at me and says i am not giving you the heisman i guess you could say i am giving you the anti-heisman and motions as if to open her legs.  It was funny as shit.  She also said she dumped dale but i don't know that i completely buy that.  Anyway, all together it was very interesting weekend.

"759142","My congratulations on your address to us this morning","After listening to your speech this morning, I am now, more than ever, proud to be an Enron Employee under your leadership.  Your commitment and fortitude under trying circumstances is always steady and going forward. During all the past years of success and truly phenomenal growth I along with my co-workers have been richly rewarded.   Not only was I rewarded economically but also my friends and superiors contributed huge amounts of time and money toward others less fortunate and able to help themselves.

This is a direct reflection of your leadership and your giving back to the community.  This leadership by example is what will sustain us in the coming months as we build our stock back up.  I have no doubt build it up we will.  There is nothing more invigorating than a challenge to show your true courage and ambition. Shifting blame and finding scapegoats has never been your style and I am very glad to see we are not starting down that road.  I feel the up coming Chairman's Award will be a great boost to morale.

People measure success very differently. I feel just as successful today as a year ago because I answer to a higher authority than our stock price. Enron's helping of our neighbors during the floods and the New Yorkers during their tragedies makes me very proud to work at this company.  Time is a better indicator of how well we persevered during these rather tumultuous times.  Here's to a better view in two thousand two.

Significant New Issuance - CSFB Commentary:

The first week of September was extremely positive for the region with a significant increase in secondary trading volumes and bond prices. Relative financial stabilisation in Argentina removed pressure from Latin American and other emerging markets, shifting the focus to the impact of local factors on prices in each region. It was a busy week in the Turkish market, which started initially on a weaker note because of the disappointing inflation data released on Monday, but then recovered to follow other Eastern European markets and closed around 1.5 points higher on the week. The long awaited resignation of the Minister of Public Works added to the positive sentiment in the market. The Russian market rallied this week, first on the back of Latam stabilisation and then encouraged by the Moody's rating upgrade (see below). Prices peaked on Thursday, immediately after the upgrade, but failed to stay at those levels due to profit taking and a sliding Latam market, closing only one point higher than last Friday. Central and Eastern European investment grade assets remained stable throughout the week, which is a good sign given the sell-off in US Treasuries. Other countries in this region gained around  point, with Romania being the best performer gaining  point.

On Wednesday, Moody's raised the ratings of outstanding Eurobonds of the Russian Federation to B2 from B3 and changed the outlook for all hard currency instruments to ""positive"" from ""stable."" Moody's noted that Russia's recent economic performance and tax reforms have generated twin surpluses (current account and budget) and large foreign currency reserves. In combination with some debt relief, these factors have made the country's capacity to service its debt much greater.","2","3","2","3","2","3","2","1","2","2"

"1108647","CA Labels","It's that time of year again - sending out 3rd quarter labels to California.  Richard & I were talking this morning and had several questions.

First - how do we reflect to our customers that used to receive BIZMIX (large commercials) in their projected labels that for the first month of the year (according to Diann Hudleston they were initially de-DASRed on Jan 31) they received the BIZMIX fuel mix and for the rest of the year the system mix?  Do we need to do a label showing a column for the Jan mix and a column for the rest of year mix with a footnote?  Additionally, has Peggy Mahoney's letter gone out yet?  I'd hate for a notation on a label to be the first thing a customer sees about this.  There is a bit of time, however, as these will go out in the October billing cycle (CSC has to have them 9/10).

Second - We returned our residential customers to the utilities the end of June.  Do we still need to send them a projected 2001 label in 3rd & 4th quarters since we did not provide their electricity during those periods?  I presume we will, however, have to send them a historical 2001 label next spring, since we did provide their electricity for at least first half of the year.

"742810","Enron Letter to Mike Gent","Jose

In the cover letter to Mike Gent to transmit our Enron SSO document, it would be good to flag to Mike that Enron will participate in any forum to discuss the formation of an SSO.  This will prevent NERC from trying to splinter EPSA members on the EISB vs NERC issue,  and claim that Enron has endorsed NERC as the SSO. We need to make clear to NERC they are not the only sandbox we will be playing in to form an SSO.  We need to safeguard our ability to keep feet on both sides of the fence.

The strategy I have been pursuing for the past 6 months has been one of keeping competition out there for SSO status.  Our support of EISB has resulted in some good changes at NERC as seen last week.  Of course we are nowhere near finished.  We need to keep the competition going between NERC and EISB now more than ever since it is likely that without competition, NERC will spinmeister all its actions as broad-based consensus and sell that to FERC and the Hill.

My new focus is to maintain support for an EISB formation that is open and inclusive so that NERC will be challenged to demonstrate its reformation process (possibly through a Blue Ribbon Panel?) is as open and inclusive as EISB's.  EPSA plans to take up DOE's offer to sponsor a forum to form the 4th quadrant of EISB and we should participate in that forum.  If NERC cannot tout its process is as open and inclusive as any other, they will lose the fight.","2","3","3","3","2","3","3","2","2","3"
"759891","SPP Retail Market Opening Testimony","AEP asked the Texas PUC to postpone opening the Texas (outside of ERCOT) retail market because there is no centralized dispatch (per Ron M's testimony on behalf on AEP).  After talking with our SPP folks (I understand that EPMI has bid to serve a portion of Entergy's load) , Jim's testimony is that the outside of ERCOT Texas market should open 1/1/02 and that other states have implemented retail open access without a centralized dispatch model (for example, AEP in Ohio, ComEd in Ilinois and Duquense in ECAR/PA).  Jim states that while RTOs and central dispatch will certainly facilitate the market, it is not absolutely required, and that, if AEP thinks that the retail market will not be competitive without it, then, perhaps, REPS other than AEP should be the only ones allowed to serve retail load in this part of Texas until central dispatch is in place.  In addition, he states that the imbalance provisions should be changed and that network firm capacity should be available to REPs (without the need for protracted system impact studies, since the load is already being served.)

Apparently, Entergy has also changed its mind and now is opposing the 1/1/02 opening of the Entergy/Texas retail market.","2","1","1","1","1","1","1","2","1","1"
"888705","November 1st Gas Issues Conference Call-- 3:30 p.m.","Some background on this issue:  It has been a hot topic at GISB for a number of months now.  It was first raised by AGA and a few LDCs (Brooklyn Union, in particular) in a rehearing request on one of the proceedings where a pipeline was filing compliance with Order 587 (the order requiring compliance with GISB).  GISB moved the issue into one of the committees, and the LDCs and a few marketers have been fighting over it ever since.  I understand that some pipelines side with the LDCs and some of them don't feel strongly about it one way or the other.  Ultimately, GISB reported to FERC that they weren't able to resolve the issue due to the conflicting viewpoints of the various segments.  Thus, the NOPR.

Input from the traders is that they don't have objections to Partial Day Recalls as long as we know the capacity is released with that right reserved, so we can value our bids accordingly.  Leslie is going to write a short pleading to emphasize this position and point out that releasing shippers should be able to specify whether or not they intended to make the release subject to partial day recalls.  It shouldn't be a big deal, because they now have to specify whether or not they are subject to the current recall provisions.  It was not spelled out in the NOPR.

We will talk to Joe, but I've been told the Enron pipelines are not too concerned about it.

By the way, I had to join Brian Redmond for a conference call yesterday at 2:30, so I couldn't join the EPSA call.  It sounds like they haven't decided whether to file or not.","1","1","1","1","2","2","2","2","3","2"

All of this was done in a very informal setting, with a free flow of information between Rick and the participants.  The attendees agreed this was a very good forum for communication.

I would like to give the entire Tax department the same opportunity.  Rick has scheduled October 30th from 2:00 - 3:00 p.m. in EB1701.

ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.

Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

"275683","Additional New Works; 5/2/01 Floor Meeting, 37th Floor","In order to maximize the potential synergies between the various mid- and back- office functions, to decrease replication errors, and to increase communication standards; are there any plans of creating a platform or reference center to bridge the differences between the systems, processes, and terminology of the various departments. Perhaps a common resource center offering access to on-line system manuals and business unit overviews (which currently exist only in paper form or in some cases within the actual system database).

The reason: With Enron's size and transaction volume, many of the functions and the data managed by various groups within Enron (i.e. credit, risk, settlements, volume management, global contracts, global counterparties, global rates, and the commercial systems) are fragmented. Having participated in various process reviews and trouble-shooting/clean-up projects there seems to be a large disconnect between groups operating in various systems. These disconnects; rather they be lack of information or understanding of how data flows between systems, how the data managed within each system impacts other upstream or downstream systems, or how the business processes within one group/system impacts the overall functionality of other groups, create large cracks producing an opportunity for mismanaged data, incomplete business reports, and increased risk to Enron.

The ideal objective; increase communication standards through a better understanding of system data functions/requirements and business processes, decrease system downtime and replication errors through a better understanding of the data relationships between systems, maximize department-to-department synergies (left hand knows what the right hand is doing), eliminate repetition, and further reduce potential risks to Enron due to information/business process oversight.","2","3","2","3","2","2","3","3","3","3"

My name is Shelley Farias and I work for EES in the 3 Allen Center.  On Friday September 14 at 5:00 P.M. as I was leaving work I saw something that frightened me outside the 3 Allen Center.  In a car parked in the circle drive was a young man about 20 years old of Middle Eastern decent taking pictures of the Enron building and the 3 Allen Center.  Security was at the scene and asked the young man to stop taking the pictures, he got back in his car and continued to take the pictures.  My husband wrote down the license plate number and make of the car and gave this information to security.  Security informed us that they would take care of the situation. I spoke to security this morning and they do not have any report of this incident or the police being notified.   Mr. Lay with everything that has happened to this country I am scared that something may happen to us.  I would like to think I can come to work and be safe, but with security not taking instances such as Friday seriously I have doubts.

It turns out that the Estate in Portland needs some of the technology equipment on Schedule 27.  This includes servers, computers, printers, etc.  We need some of the stuff on Schedule 18 such as the desks and chairs.  We are guaranteed use of this stuff so long as we stay in this building.  Therefore, we could use it forever for free if we chose to stay here.  It seems that we have a fair trade here.  If you don't convey this equipment to us the only effect is that you will likely prevent us from moving as it will be too expensive!!!  An option to buy the equipment from the estate is essentially a worthless option.  The furiture will have little value to the estate and may be a liability as demand for that stuff in Portland is low and the cost to move is high (e.g., in Mexico shutting down the office cost $40k plus storage fees to move furniture into storage).  Furthermore, I have no reason to believe that an accounting firm working for the estate will give us a ""fair"" value on the furniture.  We don't want any furniture from the 4th floor that the estate will need.  Bottom line, we can give the estate computers and servers and they can keep the fourth floor furniture and everything will work well for them.  We give up some computers and servers to the estate but keep the furniture on the 3rd floor.  Everyone is happy and it makes economic sense.

"743076","Summary or PX Credit Proposals","An update from the meeting we had with SCE on August 9:  SCE said that it has TEMPORARILY stopped charging CTC because it doesn't know what to charge for DWR. Meanwhile, it continues to keep track of the dollar flows through the TCBA and the new account set up for DWR.  Once the CPUC decides on the DWR's revenue requirement, SCE expects that it will charge generation-related CTC again.  There is also continuing CTC related to QF contracts that will return (and goes beyond 3/31/02) once QF contracts are above the ""market"".  SCE is also considering filing a petition with the CPUC to get guidance on all these matters. Once the CPUC rules on SCE""s advice letter approaches, SCE plans to go back and re-bill begining with Jan 18 (it used some different PX credit approaches early on and switched to this approach for bills going out June 4). I didn't ask the question about calculating CTC back to Jan 18.  I guess if the DWR rev req is retroactive and leaves room for CTC, they will bill it.  The other twist I had forgotten about is that they have a one-half cent charge added to the embedded gen rate of 10.27 cents (making it about 10.77 cents) that collects the $400 million that was uncollected while the CPUC played around with a rate design for the three cent surcharge.

"1278710","","So far this quarter we've spend about 18 million on a reserve that Randy Petersen/Credit are making us take on an option we have associated with the MTBE project.  In essence, Randy P doesn't understand how we trade options at Enron, and I'll be having a conversation with Rick about this.  We've spent almost 5 million in getting out of physical positions since no one will buy from or sell to us.  We can't manage the physical positions and obligations we have since there is no money available to the crude group (to purchase physical or post LC's in the case of a sale).  Wev'e also spent about 10+ million closing down books and getting out of positions as the market gives us the chance.  More than half the books have been closed and we will close/consolidate four more tonight.  As you know, getting out of any positions costs money, and the market smells blood.

Because the crude and products markets have been moving significantly recently, we can't manage our options position by getting out of them.  Again, nobody will buy from us or sell options to us, so we have to try to neg. gamma trade it.

That is the 30 second version of the cluster I'm trying to close, hope it helps.

So, can we change the severance program as I've outlined?","2","2","1","1","2","2","2","1","3","2"
"1105590","Increase in Demand for Brokerage Agreements","Sara:

How much protection do the agreements give us?  I have always assumed that they were primarily for the benefit of the brokers.  Of course, in the U.S. they are probably required by the SEC and in a country where they are not required you have to wonder how well the brokers are being policed by regulators.  I guess it makes sense to at least contact local counsel to find out what protections there are for the customer and whether or not it would be reasonable to ask for something in writing.  I don't think we need written opinions of counsel.  It might also make sense to explain to the business folks that we think there is incrementally greater legal risk in using those arrangements and that while they may be permitted to use them they should keep activities to a minimum where there is a more secure alternative.

Sorry for rambling.","1","3","2","2","3","2","3","2","1","2"
"1034017","PEER GROUP MAPPING","Steve Kean and I believe quite strongly, within a four peer group structure,  that we need to allocate somewhere between 30 and 50 percent of Gov't./ public  Affairs out of commercial support into specialized technical- there is a clear divide between individuals in the Gov't/public  Affairs groups  who are managing significant risk for the company and having a significant and  direct impact on commercial activities/ net income( these individuals should be moved to specialized technical)....and others who are performing a less strategic function( who should remain in the commercial support category). With that said, it is probably not necessary to undertake this effort for  mid-year PRC purposes since we are probably moving to a three peer stucture where that split could be achieved (for year-end purposes where the compensation impact would be felt). If we stay with the four group stucture, I intend to push hard for the remapping of Gov't Affairs by year-end.

On a completely seperate issue, I continue to be  very concerned about the impact of the ""preferred"" distribution  relative to the bottom category for "" commercial support"" groups(I'm not implying this is'nt an issue for commercial groups- I just don't have the same ability to assess the impact there)....the concern, simply stated,  is that  it may be entirely  counterproductive to force individuals who are not performance problems  into a category that has significant implications for their careers here at Enron, particularly after going thru the past year where many of the non-performers in my group and others  were moved out of the company- the replacement costs for moving good performers out of the company for the sake of a ""preferred"" distribution are quite high...and that is even before you begin  to assess the incalcuable damage to morale that will invariably occour.

"1312610","Wessex Weekly Update","I know it must be frustrating being a ocean away and not really knowing what is going on.  I can assure you that at times I too feel that I do not know everything that is going and that is probably correct.  I can tell you that Jeff McMahon did receive the offer from the Royal Bank of Scotland at or around RAB.  I have supplied him the potential financial impact of Enron accepting that offer.  As of yesterday no decision had been made about responding to their offer.  I suspect that a decision should be made early next week.  I would appreciate your thoughts as soon as you can supply them to me.

Ken Lay and Dynegy have both characterised Enron's investments in water assets as non-core which means of cource that they will be divested in due time.  I would think that that would be the final straw that triggers the goodwill impairment.  We all recommended that if Enron could not support the goodwill remaining on the books then we should proceed with trying to sell Wessex at or around RAB.  That is where we are right now.

"1313038","Arctic Outbreak Forecast","Arctic Outbreak Forecast      Issued:   08:00 PM Saturday November 24, 2001   Surge of Arctic Air Possible    Cold air under strong high pressure is poised to move south from the Arctic regions of Canada and Siberia this coming week. By normal standards, this air will not be all that cold, considering it is of Arctic origin. But, considering the time of year and how unseasonably warm it has been recently, this punch of Arctic air will bring an abrupt change for most of the week ahead.   A deep trough of low pressure, currently digging into the southwest U.S. will traverse the central states early this week, opening the gates behind to the air that is pooled in northern Canada. Beginning late Sunday or early Monday, the Arctic front will begin its plunge into the lower 48, reaching the Gulf Coast overnight Monday night.   The potential is for temperatures, across all the eastern half of the U.S., except Florida, to plummet as much as 30 degrees from Tuesday to Thursday, but the coldest nights could be later in the week as the skies clear. For Florida, the greatest temperature changes won't come until the weekend.   On a more uncertain note, there are also early indications of possible winter weather after midweek from east Texas across northern Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and northward into the Midwest.   We will continue to monitor this developing weather situation and the potential for winter weather.

"1114453","Suggestions to help short term morale","I am forwarding this message to you sent to me by Bob Superty.  Bob is the director of Gas Logistics for Enron Americas, and attended the lunch meeting that I held yesterday.  I asked all in attendance to let me know if they had ideas on things that could be done to improve employee morale.  I can always count on Bob to give thoughtful consideration to this type of request.  Here are his ideas.  Some of these I can orchestrate for my operations team and the broader Enron Net Works employee base.  Some of these suggestions could impact a broader base of employees.  I would be happy to lead any or all of these efforts on an Enron-wide basis is you think that would be appropriate.  I could certainly use some help, however.

You may already have a venue for this, but maybe it would be a good idea to put together a small team of interested individuals (like Bob Superty) who could make suggestions in the short run on ideas that could improve employee morale.  Not a formalized committee, and not even one that would have to be announced or publicized.  Just an ad hoc group to make a difference now.  Maybe this doesn't have to be corporate wide.  Maybe each business unit could put together an ad hoc group, if they feel that it is appropriate for their business unit, and maybe these various ad hoc groups could just share ideas.  This might be even more effective with buy-in and initiative from the business units, rather than the feel of a corporate overlay.  As I am typing, I am thinking that maybe we will pilot this in Enron Net Works and simply share what we are doing with others.","2","2","2","2","1","2","1","1","2","1"

While this draft does not refer to any concept of Non-Developing Parties, the MOU does not bind Enron to become a Rejoining Partner in ANNGTC, and you have verbally told TCPL, El Paso and PGT that we are not going to rejoin until the old liabilities are cleared up.  This should be communicated to all parties in writing in the near future (see MOU Sec 17 re good faith intent of the parties regarding the MOU transactions).   In light of the non-binding nature of the MOU, it seems reasonable to go forward with the group under the proposed terms, even though Drew has prepared extensive comments on the MOU to introduce the Non-Developing Partner concept.  This concept can still be proposed during the next phase, when we work on amending the ANNGTC Partnership Agreement.  If we should talk further give me a call at 402=398-7888.

Under your ""leadership"" the shareholders have been devastated, employees have lost their retirements, college funds have been desiminated and reputations have been ruined, including your own.

While I applaud your forgoing of the $60 million dollar payment I suspect having taken it would have only added to outrage and probably weakend your position in forthcoming lawsuits and don't feel that it was as self efacing as you have lead us to believe . Under your direction Enron has promoted bafoons, charletons and incompetents to the highest management ranks.  You personally did everything imaginable to lose the confidence of the investment community, in my opinion. This has got to be the financial disaster of the decade, all under your direction.

You said Jeff Skilling left for ""personal reasons"" and there were not hidden financial problems. You told us you were becoming more transparent in financial disclosures and then tried to slip a $1.2 Billion dollar equity reduction by us. The list goes on and on. Why should we believe you now.

GISB has since adopted standardized data formats for the transactional reporting, recently published in GISB version 1.5 standards.  While these standard formats have been adopted, and I believe that we are following these formats, they haven't yet been adopted by FERC -- so other pipelines may or may not yet be following.

We were using historical rates (no fuel adjustment because we collect it in fuel sales) through 2006.  After 2006, I calculated an adjustment to add to the historical rates (assuming that we would recapture some of the value of the spread in the rate) and it made the rate greater than the max tariff rate.  Davis and I discussed that we didn't think we should assume anything in the models over max rate, so Davis said he would cap the rate at max, after 2006.  (All of this is just pertaining to the West rates.)

The historical average West rate is $.2565.  The historical West rate with fuel adjustment added is $.3404.  The max rate is $.2868.

I'm still not sure if it is a two-way termination (yes I know the difference) because there's no language that indicates we'd be paid if we're in the money in a termination.  There is a provision that allows us to cease delivery ""by reason of ... significant change in operating condition""; if we don't deliver, there's an LD calculation, which if positive, we have to pay.  There doesn't appear to be any language that causes WEPCo to pay us if we don't deliver and we're in the money.  (Hence my question to David) Otherwise, the only way to terminate is with one year's advance written notice - there are no Event of Default provisions and remedies, such as for bankruptcy.

What I didn't know was your longer term view of the market - this obviously matters in evaluating their offer if the contract is one way and we are unhedged.

"1114461","November Newsletter Deadline","I will mail the checks and money to Barb.  There was one other item that I was going to deliver to you.  One of the women who had prepared snacks for the last general meeting turnedin the recipe for her pumpkin dip.  She said that many people were asking her for it, and if we had room, maybe we could publish it in the newsletter.  I told her that we would have to see how much official material we have from the chapter and if we wind up with a needed ""filler"".  Let me know if you do need a filler, and I can send the recipe via an attachment.  Feel free to call me at work - 713-853-5926.  I have the recipe in my briefcase.

Glad Nancy got back to you on the food drive - or lack there of!

At fall regional training, I attended a Communications session - they provided a list by month of desired national information (from the national website) to be included in our newsletters.  Had planned to drop that off as well.  I am still at home right now, but I can fax that to you when I get to the office a little later.

At the present time, firm capacity is not available on PNM's system during peak periods, since all firm capacity on PNM's system is subject to recall by PNM in order to maintain service to core customers.  If in the future, however, circumstances change and Transwestern is able to acquire firm capacity on the PNM system which is not subject to recall or other prior commitment, Transwestern can do so.  Transwestern will be required to file a revised tariff sheet to reflect thte determinations made in this order before it can acquire such furm capacity during the peak period.

Between job prospects, my cold and coming to grips with some of the past i've just been a little detached from myself.  I was also in the midst of a taxing conversation with ted when we were IM'ing and it was bringing back stuff too.  I'm just struggling with this pattern of attaching myself to men who are ultimately either literally not available or emotionally not availabe.  and this whole mm not contacting me has got me very conflicted....b/c to be honest, i really hope he never contacts me again...but i also feel like him not contacting implies that he believes there is something wrong with even our casual interaction (and i'm not disagreeing), which ulitmately makes me feel guilty and rotten.  so anyway...i think i just want something to come along that feels good..whether that be a job,a guy,a location, a massage...whatever.  i'm just very disappointed with mediocrity.  i feel very luke warm about too many things.

To recap, with that option, EWS would assume internal management of the settlements function, including managing data requirements to and from the outsource providers,  and EES would retain the service management function, defining service levels and pricing, plus serving as the interface with EES customers.

We will review with Tim, Kevin, Don and Rogers the more detailed recommendations from this team by mid week.  Then we should have a final proposal of roles and responsibilities for EWS and EES around the settlements function before the end of this week.

"1336569","A dissapointed stockholder","I have been an Enron stockholder for several years  and I am very disappointed with the events of the last two weeks.  I find  the allegations of accounting irregularities incredible.  I would like to  know how closely the board had been monitoring the activities of the CFO and  whether it approved the partnerships that have led to the SEC investigation and  the dramatic decline in the company's stock price.  I would suggest that  the compensation of senior management may be too heavily weighted towards  bonuses (giving some the incentive to manipulate the numbers to increase their  bonuses) and not heavily weighted enough towards stock options.  I would  hope in the future the goals of the board and senior management will be aligned  with stockholders (increasing shareholder value).  While I know it is not  reason to have expected the stock price to stay in the high 80s, I consider the  drop in the last two weeks (apparently as the result of fraud) to be  inexcusable.  I believe the board owes all stockholders an explanation that  will finally clear the air about this mess (maybe the markets will trust Enron  again if it replaces evasion with candor).  Please help return credibility  and ethics to this company, which apparently are badly needed.

"721260","Block III Recall Rights","We are just looking for further verfication that the RErecall can be enacted on 24 hours notice regarding of the term of the proposed recall.  I believe there are some distinctions relative to the requested term. To the extent that there is a perpetual 24 hour RErecall (is 24 hours based on date recall is effectuated or the date gas flows pursuant to recall?), PG&E paid $58 million for protection that is not worth very much.

Just looking for greater clarification. To the extent it may help us with our position regarding the ability to turn back the 200 M2/d of capacity, it may be worth the expense to have independent verfication.

I have met and spent time with the CEO of S&P.  I know him through Michael Lewan, one of our DC consultants.  You may know of that S&P is owned by McGraw Hill.  Michael Lewan gave the ""Steve Kean"" (and #3) of McGraw Hill his very first job in life.  Glenn then introduced me to the CEO of S&P, Leo O'Neill.  Leo is a very approachable person who readily made acquaintances with me b/c of his great fondness for Bob Rubin and Michael Lewan.  Leo told me several stories of how he always ""thinks better of"" the CEOs who sit down with him and engage in honest conversation when S&P is evaluating its ratings of a company.  That is how Leo got to know Bob; Leo was very impressed with how Bob acted when S&P was contemplating action against Goldman Sachs many years ago.  Second, the recently resigned Head of Enforcement of the SEC is a friend from my gym.  For several years I spent most mornings with him as we shared the same personal trainer.  I am sure Richard hired most if not all of the current SEC enforcement staff.  I am not sure where Richard landed upon his departure, as he wanted to just take time off before starting his next career.  These two contacts are small, but thought you might want to include them in your thinking.  Hope all is well.","2","2","2","2","1","1","2","2","2","1"

I've been offering Paul the chance to do much more outward-facing commercial work digging into things like Huberator and PowerITS (from this morning's articles) as well as any potential sales of our platform technology in Europe.  He expresses keen interest, but his heart seems to be in Canada.  He has committed to come to some career conclusions within the next week or two.

We've also been speaking with Heather Kendall, a director who works for Gary Hickerson in London helping to roll-up the Ag business.  I've worked with her before, and she would be great for EnronOnline's efforts at gaining traction in new products, marketing and origination out of London.  Her issue is wanting to come back to Houston at some point.  I suppose I need your help in 2 ways.  First, if you know Heather and are comfortable nudging her toward our shop, I think it would go a long way.  Second, if you are familiar with anyone else in London with deep Enron background and broad commercial shoulders who's looking for an open lane, we need to talk to them.  Clearly Paul and Lara are doing a great job, but we need even more firepower over there to iron out some of the issues the desks are facing, both internally and externally.

"1275250","Possible press release before market open on 11/20/01","First version:  First paragraph probably falls under the requirements of SEC Regulation M-A (communications regarding the Enron/Dynegy merger).  This could be viewed as soliciting support for the merger (""merger is in the best interests of shreholders.."" etc.).  As such, it would have to include the Rule 425 legend and be filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 425 (unless you can argue that the reference to the merger is only in a non-substantive way---it doesn't read that way to me).  Also, the reference in that same first paragraph to ""powerful competitor"" may not sit well with the FTC with respect to the antitrust issues (probably not fatal, but we ought to think of another desciptive word).

Second version:  Technically, I would say ""secured"" by, as opposed to ""supported"" by the assets of the pipelines when referring to the credit support for the facilities.  Second paragraph:  Same comments as the first paragraph in the first version addressed above.  Third paragraph:  I don't think it is a good idea to talk about ""strong verbal indications"" regarding the extension of maturities unless you are just about 100% confident that they will, in fact, be extended.  I think we are sending a message by such a statement that this maturity will be extended.  If there is a chance that it will not, I think this is a risky statement to make.  If it is made, perhaps we should include a forward looking statement factor to the effect ""factors include Enron's ability to restructure scheduled maturities of debt""  (but my first choice would be not to include the quote).  I will try to be in early in the morning if you want to discuss.  Thanks, Rex","1","2","1","1","3","1","2","3","2","2"

These volumes are coming through the Supply verifications and Sales invoices but are not being paid, nor being sent out and therefore creating issues for Settlements.   I remember that Sylvia Campos had stated that those tickets were not possible to put in because Nicor is an Hub not a storage facility.

"759467","Meeting with State Dept. re Dabhol","Jim

I met yesterday with  Alan Larson's staff at State to bring them up to date on where we are and urge further efforts by State Dept to get the Prime Minkister's office to engage in meaningful negotiations on Dabhol.  State at this point remains fully sympathetic to the position we are in and recognizes that a closer U.S.-Indian relationship long term must be built on a sound commercial relationship, which cannot exist so long as Dabhol remains unaddressed and unresolved.  To that end their word is that the commercial dialogue continues and continues as a priority.  Larson, Undersecretary of State for Economic and Business Affairs, has been appointed USG Coordinator of the bilateral commercial relationship and a trip planned in November to go to India remains on at the behest of the Ambassador.   This could certainly change with the Afghan situation but this is the situation as of now.

The Ambassador is a critical player for us in terms of his daily interaction with Mishra and other senior Indian govt. officals.  We need to keep him up to speed and view him as a critical resource to pressure the PMO.  Particularly at this juncture, when India is working hard to make sure they are perceived by the USG to be at least as supportive as Pakistan to the US, a word from the Ambassador to the PM to get Dabhol off the table would be jolting. I would encourage Wade to try to meet with him and send the message that he has to step up the pressure to get the Indian side to seriously negotiate.  thanks John","2","2","1","1","3","2","2","3","3","3"
"743370","Pennsylvania $147,000 EES Assessment","EES was recently assessed $147,000 by the Pennsylvania PUC as a method of recovering their costs.  Enron's local PA attorney, Kevin Moody of Wolf, Block, Schorr and Solis-Cohen LLP, notified us that he has taken the lead for a group of natural gas suppliers to challenge the assessments and inquired if Enron wanted to be a part of the group.  The group includes IOGA (an association of oil & gas suppliers in PA), TXU, Hess, New Power, and 4 others.  Moody successfully got a postponement of the payments until Oct 16.  EES is included in the postponement at this time.  The options are to litigate the assessment (Moody feels we are on solid ground to prevail) or to negotiate a settlement with the PUC where we agree to some assessment to be determined.  Litigating the assessment could cost about $50K - $60K (in addition to the $25K to date) whereas settling would obviously be less expensive initially but would provide an assessment for each year going forward.  Moody id meeting with the PA PUC this Friday to determine what would be the best way to proceed (he is hoping to convince them that the statute is quite clear that they cannot make the assessment and that they withdraw it).  We will have a better grasp of the situation and clearer path for the direction we should pursue after that meeting.  I will keep you informed.","2","2","1","1","3","1","2","2","1","1"

In reference to shipping cost to Texas, shipping company's usually charge by size, weight, and distance travelled.  The bike doesn't weigh that much, but you'd probably have to check with a truck line to verify a freight prices.  In regard to the title, I do have the title, but

it's still in the person's name that I purchased the bike from.  He had it licensed, with tags on it, and rode it on the street.  I bought it just as a pit/play bike.  I take it to local motorcycle races on a trailer as a pit bike and ride it around my neighborhood, so I never licensed it to keep from paying sales tax.  If it becomes an issue, I can retitle it in my name. The unit has somewhere around 980 miles on it, and it has the optional headlight fairing and engine/radiator shroud/cowl.  The only thing that I did to it when I bought it was change all the fluids, lube, check everything over and adjust things as needed.  Let me know if you have any further questions or need more info.

Upon Clyde's return we shall revisit the thorny WSPP meeting in Colorado in the modern way, by phone for lack of my speed and agility.

The EEI creep was evident when Mike Small after himself, personally,  taking credit for drafting Enron's market disruption language (he said it was very time consuming to draft) proceeded to be challenged by all the EEI members who the day before had sat around the table for 2 productive hours challenging certain concepts that Enron originally proposed (as a result we will be modifying our language soon since some good issues were raised).  After hearing the new issues Mike threw up his arms and asked that we propose new language.  Afterwards, I spoke with Mike, sorry Clyde, and proposed to meet with him to discuss the possibility of bringing the groups together, using the absurdity of the market disruption language discussion as good evidence of what we could achieve together.  He said theoretically that might be able to happen but he never saw it happening.  I asked why.  He said too painful.  What pain.  He said Shari Stack.  I said one bad day in Newport.  He stopped talking.  He did ask if we wouldn't sit down with him and tell him line by line why we don't like the WSPP. , I think this meager offer is something we can't miss so ....

I am pleased to say that he has agreed to enter into a consulting arrangement with the company to advise me and the Board of Directors.

Now it's time to look forward.

With Jeff leaving, the Board has asked me to resume the responsibilities of President and CEO in addition to my role as Chairman of the Board.  I have agreed.  I want to assure you that I have never felt better about the prospects for the company.  All of you know that our stock price has suffered substantially over the last few months.  One of my top priorities will be to restore a significant amount of the stock value we have lost as soon as possible.  Our performance has never been stronger; our business model has never been more robust; our growth has never been more certain; and most importantly, we have never had a better nor deeper pool of talent throughout the company.  We have the finest organization in American business today.  Together, we will make Enron the world's leading company.

On Thursday at 10:00 a.m. Houston time, we will hold an all employee meeting at the Hyatt.  We will broadcast the meeting to our employees around the world where technically available, and I look forward to seeing many of you there.","3","3","3","3","3","2","1","2","3","2"
"1248894","Needles Pressure Requirement","I've got a copy of the SoCal contract for Needles.  The exact wording for the pressure requirement is:

SECTION 5. PRESSURE.

Seller shall tender gas to Buyer, at the delivery point on the California/Arizona border near Needles, California, at a pressure of not less than 750 PSIG, and not more than 1000 psiq, with an anticipated nominal operating pressure of approximately 800 psig, unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties. For purposes of this Service Agreement, pressure at the delivery point shall be calculated from actual readings at Seller's Needles measurement facility utilising generally accepted engineering formulas designed to calculate a pressure drop over a given distance of pipeline, gravity, temperature, and flow rate and other variables as may be reasonably necessary to make such computation, and may be confirmed by calculations at Buyer's North Needles Compressor station.

It is my interpretation that our pressure requirement occurs exactly at the California/Arizona state line and we can use modeling methods to determine the required outlet pressure at the Needles station required to achieve 800 psig at the state line.","3","3","2","3","2","1","2","2","3","2"
"1105561","EOL","Thanks for your note.  Just so you have the whole picture -- our analysis from a US law perspective is that there is a tension between wanting the transactions on the system to be enforceable and wanting out of the mistake trades.  The offline unwind is by far the best approach when the mistake is not blatant since it assumes the binding nature of the original trade.  We have been handling these by using a written termination rather than a reverse trade.  This is universally the approach we have taken when our traders have agreed to let a customer out of a trade the customer claims was done by mistake on their part.  This happens often enough that we have given the confirm desk a termination agreement form to use as needed (Tana can get you a copy if you want it).  But when the counterparty refuses to let us out of a trade that is a mistake on our part, our only hope is that the mistake is so blatant that we can claim mutual mistake.  Under US law when there is mutual mistake the contract is actually never formed.  In that case, the original trade is not enforceable and there is nothing to unwind.  One alternative we have used is to simply remove the transaction from the customer's ""completed transactions"" section as if it had never happened.  As far as I know, we have only had to do this once or twice.","3","2","3","3","1","2","3","1","3","2"

"732667","Job Status","Hey Gerald, I was talking with Kenny Smith about LRC, and the people associated with HPL that went over with AEP, when I thought of a certain facility planner. I looked at the Enron directory, and found that you were still with Enron. I presume you're still with ENA. Are you still working contracts with them? I had a chance to speak with Kevin Kuehler a few months ago, and according to him AEP is busy relooking at all kind of possibilities (old estimates). I don't know how long that kind of enthusiasm will last. AEP will probably find out (what ENA already knew) how hard it is to make some good margins.

"764769","Columbia Gulf order on negotiated rates","I think we ought to discuss the Order with Columbia Gulf.  Its possible we are ok.  The problem FERC seems to have is that under the negotiated contract it is impossible for anyone but Columbia and the Shipper to know what the rate is at the time of the transaction.  Columbia's deal contains a default rate (based on index differentials) applicable if the parties are unable to agree on a basis price used to determine the ""Negotiated Daily Reservation Charge"".   To avoid the application of the default rate, the ""Negotiated Daily Reservation Charge"" requires Columbia and the shipper to negotiate, and agree,  to a basis number on a daily basis.  The parties did not specify particular index's for the purpose of calculating basis.  Thus, under Columbia's deal only the default rate can be determined at the time of the transaction.  In contrast, Transwestern's deals appear to be similar to Columbia's default rate; i.e., a rate based upon index's where the index's are agreed upon and stated upfront.  Thanks.

"56419","Replacement Cost Values","The 2001 annual allocated premium for these assets for property insurance is $670,000 based upon ENA's 2001 reported value of approximately $470,000,000.  The pro-rata credit for 7 months, assuming a 5-31-01 sale date, would be $390,833.

Underwriters require an update of values and exposures annually at renewal. Gathering these values within Enron normally requires 30 to 45 days.  We use these same values in the allocation system. Unless the value change is significant, the actual cost of insurance to the outside insurers will not change  Once you complete your entire study of replacement cost values, we can discuss whether approaching underwriters is warranted.

If we internally adjust your allocation mid-year, we must move the premium that we take away from you to the other participants in the program.  As you know, the remainder of Enron did not stand still while you sold Bammel.  We have not tried this before, however, I suspect if approached with the additional premium as a result reducing ENA's allocation, all the other operating entities would want to re-submit their revised  values as well and we would find ourselves in a constant state of adjustment.  In view of the time required, this is neither practical nor cost effective for Enron.  In view of the relatively small numbers, I doubt that Corp. would entertain this proposition either, however, we can approach them if you wish.","3","3","1","3","2","2","2","3","2","2"

"1144632","Chinese Wall Resource Group","You have been designated as a member of the ""Resource Group"" for purposes of the Enron Wholesale Services (""EWS"") Chinese Wall policy, which is currently being revised to reflect the new EWS organizational structure.

The Chinese Wall policy serves to reduce the risk of insider trading liability by keeping material non-public information ""walled off"" from our equity trading personnel.  The Resource Group acts as a sort of ""filter"" so that certain information may pass through the ""wall"", under appropriate controls.  It is critical that we enforce proper compliance with the Chinese Wall policy.  Without this policy, Enron would not be able to engage in equity trading activities.

Early next year, the ENA Legal Department will conduct training sessions on Chinese Wall policies and procedures for our equity traders, Resource Group members, and other appropriate employees.  A larger group of employees will receive the newly revised policies and procedures and be asked to certify compliance.  In the meantime, please feel free to call Lance Schuler at 35419, Bob Bruce at 57780, or me at 36544 should you have any questions concerning the policy or the role of the Resource Group.","3","3","3","3","3","3","3","2","2","3"
"84099","Montana Power Company (MPC) Energy Imbalance","Bill; Mike Cashell (MPC's Transmission Mgr.) just phoned me concerned, because MPC's Real-Time group requested EPMI purchase energy for them under our existing Energy Imbalance structure, and was notified by our Real-Time group that due to the newly implemented FERC price cap, we were have difficulty securing any resources.  Just to clarify things, we are settling MPC's Choice customers Energy Imbalance position, and PP&L Montana has the right to any length resulting from MPC's ""domestic"" load Energy Imbalance.  In other words MPC is settling two separate Energy Imbalance accounts, so during the hour they may be turning energy back to PP&L Montana, while at the same time finding themselves short for the Choice loads.  During the recent bullish pricing conditions, Choice customer were leaving themselves long, as of late, MPC is experiencing the Choice customers doing the opposite, positioning themselves short.  The net result is that MPC will most likely be expecting us to fill a short position from this point on, so I'd really like to see what we can do to honor their requests, mindful of the favorable position we've enjoyed over the last several months. Let me know if you'd like to discuss this further, or better yet if you've got a workable solution to the problem.  In the meantime, thanks again to you and your staff for the outstanding performance thus far in dealing with MPC.   John","2","3","2","3","3","1","1","2","2","1"
"1248919","Citizens Flagstaff Interconnect","Gale, here is the information that I have available about the subject interconnect.  The actual project is to install an additional tap and measuring facilities at the end of the lateral for peak deliveries of 12-15 MMcfd to ENA for power generating.  The problem is that the lateral capacity is about 25-27 MMcfd based upon turbine meter capacity for the Citizens Flagstaff point, but Citizens has about 25 MMcfd scheduled at their three points on the west end.  Their contract allows for them to take full obligations at either point (Kevin is checking on this); however, I don't believe that their flow regulation at the Flagstaff point (two-2"" regulators) can do more than 15 MMcfd (my intuitive guess, needs to be checked or verified).  Pressure - TW may be between 725-775 psig at peak TW mainline flows to Ca., Citizens pressure is reported to be around 365 psig downstream of control valves.

The greatest daily volume (MN 9213) since Jan 2000 was 11942 Mcf on Jan. 18, 2001 (as can be seen in the attached Excel worksheet extracted from MIPS meas. data).  The flow graph on Jan 18, 2001 also obtained from MIPS is shown below:

Planning Question: if Citizens meter capacity is say 15 MMcfd at some pressure, can we subscribe the remaining lateral capacity to ENA and still maintain pressure and volume obligations to either Citizens or ENA?  What would new pressure conditions look like flowing 30 MMcfd through the lateral?","2","2","1","1","3","2","1","2","2","2"

As discussed, we propose a 3% adjustment to the base salaries of the under $100k employees to be included in the NETCo offer letters we may produce next week (this is separate from any promotions we may want to make - we will give you a list by Friday pm). I have spoken with John and Louise and they are in agreement. Following our last conversation I believed you also were in agreement. Please confirm.

The salary increase will NOT be communicated as a subsidy for additional benefits costs, but as a modified/streamlined annual base salary review which we would do at this time of year, in the normal course of business.

"1353855","Comments of Wolak","Wolak makes some good points.  In ERCOT, Enron is in support of nodal pricing.  I would not go so far as to say we are pushing for PJM's implementation, however, but for a market with nodal prices (and unilateral bids - aka unbalanced schedules, congestion reflect by price differentials, etc).  I was unaware PJM had such great power to alter bids.  This is something we don't want, and something for which I am not aware we have advocated.  Perhaps in Enron's promotion of locational prices, it has been retold as PJM-style locational prices.  Given that PJM is the most commonly cited example of locational prices, it does not surprise me to have the sloppiness in discussions that could lead to the rumors.

"725369","Gallup Peak","All GC's

After utilizing the Gallup Peak Avoidance program and talking with Gary Choquette the following procedures should be used to minimize power usage during peak periods.  The unit should be slowed down when the digital Tri-State Power Peak In Progress (CLC) goes into alarm and reads ""PEAK"".  The unit should remain slowed down until the Tri-State Power Peak In Progress (CLC) returns to ""NORMAL"".  The program will be adjusted to insure the unit is slowed down long enough to avoid the peak.  The analog values are to provide advance warning that a peak may occur.  If you have any question call me at 713-853-1534.

"1122541","UGGGHHHHH","I know, I know.  It's still weird to me.  While I thought it was great that Lisa was holding back on the physical side of this relationship early on...I'm beginning to wonder if she really likes him, or just likes having someone to talk to who will cater to her.  I mean, I'm all for prudence when it comes to the physical side of relationships, but after a month of constant contact and interaction I would have to question the fact I didn't feel compelled to completely jump the guy.  That's not to say I would, but I'd still have to question the lack of desire to do so.  I just don't get the impression that she is that attracted to him.  Seems more like ""good buddy"" to me.  I think she misses the Matt's, Alan's, Thatcher's, etc. that she got that from in the past.

On the plus sides, he is a very happy person who loves to smile and is pleasant to be around.  I just get squeamish watching people cuddle so much.  I'm having flashbacks to sharing a room with Jen when Craigers was in the picture.  It's not a pleasant memory, trust me.  I do think it's weird that Lisa never wants me to leave their presence...they both questioned me when I took off to bed last night around 9:30...I just wanted out.
