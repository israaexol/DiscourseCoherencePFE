"C05760125_1","Hilda Solis Tom and Craig--","Madame Secretary:

Thank you for reaching out to Secretary Solis and convincing her to join the Verification Commission. She and Ricardo Lagos will make for a very high profile and effective international component of the Commission.

We will meet with her this morning at 10 am to brief her for Tuesday's journey to Honduras. At this point, it appears we have a military aircraft available. The plan is for the U.S. Delegation to depart D.C., stop in Miami to pick up Ricardo Lagos, and arrive in Tegucigalpa together. We think this will send a powerful message to Hondurans and leave no doubt about our commitment to seeing this process through to a successful conclusion.

You should be aware that Ambassador Hugo Llorens is under public assault. The Wall Street Journal dedicates its America's column this morning to attacking him and calling for his removal. Last Friday, Representative Connie Mack did the same. This chorus will grow as the extent of our accomplishment is understood. Llorens is a tough, stalwart guy. He and his Mission have held firm during this crisis. A call from you would be a big boost. Finally, we will hold an IPC today to identify further steps. We will keep you up to date on these steps and identify further opportunities for your engagement.

I want to thank you for your leadership and support during this long crisis. Your willingness to engage at key moments and take risks at the right time have propelled us much further than anyone expected. Your diplomacy prevented a debilitating civil conflict in Honduras that would have destabilized Central America and undermined two decades of our efforts. We now have a big opportunity in front of us, and for that we are grateful to you. Regards, Tom","3","3","3","3","2","3","2","2","2","2"
"C05768263_2","","Cheryl, Jake,

I received a call from Masood Ahmed, Director of the Middle East Department at the IMF. Apparently at the Haiti meeting in NYC, the Secretary had a conversation with IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn in which she expressed an interest in meeting with him to discuss the IMF's work in Haiti and other places.

A few weeks earlier, apparently she talked briefly with Mr. Ahmed at a meeting about Pakistan, and also expressed an interest in meeting with the IMF to discuss their work.

The Managing Director would be very happy to meet with her. But I think they wanted to know whether she was really interested in meeting, or whether she was being diplomatic and polite. For what it's worth, I think a meeting could be very useful. Someone from Treasury would want to sit in.

How should I respond to them?

"C05771873_1","Framing Statement - State Draft","We anticipate the release of what are claimed to be several hundred thousand classified State department cables on Sunday night that detail private diplomatic discussions with foreign governments. By its very nature, field reporting to Washington is candid and often incomplete information. It is not an expression of policy, nor does it always shape final policy decisions. Nevertheless, these cables could compromise private discussions with foreign governments and opposition leaders, and when the substance of private conversations is printed on the front pages of newspapers across the world, it can deeply impact not only US foreign policy interests, but those of our allies and friends around the world. To be clear -- such disclosures put at risk our diplomats, intelligence professionals, and people around the world who come to the United States for assistance in promoting democracy and open government. These documents also may include named individuals who in many cases live and work under oppressive regimes and who are trying to create more open and free societies. President Obama supports responsible, accountable, and open government at home and around the world, but this reckless and dangerous action runs counter to that goal. By releasing stolen and classified documents, Wikileaks has put at risk not only the cause of human rights but also the lives and work of these individuals. We condemn in the strongest terms the unauthorized disclosure of classified documents and sensitive national security information.","3","3","3","3","3","2","3","2","1","2"
"C05768528_2","","Spoke to Ed Levine today to follow up on Friday's briefing, address the few take-backs we owed them, and ask about their timeline for providing us with the resolution of ratification.

First, Ed said that he thought Friday's briefing accomplished what he had hoped — that we were able to exhaust the Committee's questions and address all other outstanding concerns. Right now, the Majority staff is in the process of making final tweaks to a draft resolution of ratification. They expect to march down the hall to the Minority very soon and negotiate with them on the draft text. I expressed our wish to receive the draft resolution before POTUS leaves on his trip on the 18th, to show momentum that Senate consideration is moving forward. Ed said that he expect the Committee to meet that timeline and hopes to provide State with an agreed upon draft resolution by the end of this week/early next week.

Second, I asked if Senator Kerry would consider making some sort of public statement in support of the Treaties prior to the POTUS visit to Australia. He said that was a fair request and he would kick around the idea with his colleagues of inserting a floor statement into the Congressional Record.

Finally, I should just mention that Ed stressed twice how much he hoped that once the resolution is provided to the State, that we would be able to agree to most of the text. Obviously, I said that would depend on what it looked like. He understood, but just wanted folks to know that the heavy lifting is occurring in the Committee now (between the Majority and Minority) and once the Committee acts on it, he expects little controversy on the floor.

Hague was on identical wave length on Libya. Brits taking domestic heat over difficulties in extracting citizens, Cameron's absence in Gulf, etc. Hague had just finished crisis mtg within FCO, and also working on op to get oil workers in south out.

Hague confident that EU measures will be finalized in next few days. Had just talked to Lavrov, who was constructive on UNSCR, supportive of vote on Monday and raising relatively minor textual concerns. Lay did not object to ICC reference. Hague trying to reach S Af FM later today.

Hague and Ricketts agreed that UN ought to have central organizing role on post-Qadhafi efforts in Libya. Want to coordinate closely with us.

Requires big ideas on support for pol institution building, economic modernization (esp trade liberalization), and peace process.

"C05793399_3","Touching base on the Hillary Rodham Clinton School proposal","Dear Cheryl,

You may recall that we met late last year when Secretary Clinton received Bernard Schwartz and me to discuss our proposal to raise a significant amount of private funds (without her involvement) to enable Baruch College to re-name and expand its School of Public Affairs as the ""Hillary Rodham Clinton School of Public and International Affairs"" and to establish, in parallel, the ""Hillary Rodham Clinton Library"" to house her correspondence as First Lady, Senator and Secretary of State. When we concluded the meeting, Secretary Clinton indicated that she was

intrigued by the proposal, but that it was premature to make a decision, given that she had not yet decided about her post-government plans.

Bernard and I responded that we fully understood this point and that we were prepared to be patient while her thinking evolved. During this time, we have refrained (and will continue to refrain) from any fundraising efforts or any public discussion of the idea. We are, in fact, eager to coordinate closely (and quietly) with you and the Secretary's other key staff as her thinking and planning evolves over the coming months. At the same time, I can report that Bernard and I have privately discussed the matter with the CUNY Chancellor, Matthew Goldstein, who is enthusiastically supportive of the idea and prepared to be helpful in a variety of ways.

At this point, I am seeking only to gain assurance that the proposal continues to be under active consideration by Secretary Clinton, and that we might be able to engage with you and/or Huma Abedin at an appropriate point in the coming months to discuss the details and our plans for implementation.

"C05784310_25","","A very quick reaction:

Two elements of this have a direct bearing on U.S.-Pal relations: 1) the security forces, and 2) the composition on the government. On the first, the deal described below sounds ok, i.e. there will be separate security forces in Gaza and the West Bank. On the second, it's not so good. A government of independents, will still have to meet Quartet principles for us to provide direct assistance. A government without a political program is a problem if there is no affirmative affirmation of Q principles. And I assume a government like this does not include Salam. The bottom line is that our direct budget support to the PA will probably come to an end, and many of our other activities with the PA including the training program for the PASF are in jeopardy.

This will also have a bearing on the MEP, and that will also probably not be positive.","2","2","2","2","1","1","1","2","2","1"

"C05788787_2","","We have indications that our colleagues in USAID are shifting the venue for our global health discussions from the interagency GHI process led by State to the Congress. The most recent legislation requires the production of two reports by the Department of State, with the consultation of the USAID Administrator, to Congress: an update on the benchmark process to be delivered on February 6th and every ninety days thereafter and a report on the implications of moving from PEPFAR to USAID to be delivered in late May. It is commonly believed, by key stakeholders, that these reports came at the request of USAID despite USAID's protestations to the contrary.

The House also proposed language to consolidate all global health budgets, including PEPFAR, under USAID. This language was not included in the final legislation.

The PEPFAR report is relevant for your meeting with Kay Warren on Monday because the faith-based community, and the global health leaders affiliated with President Bush, were alarmed by these actions and are concerned that USAID's actions may sever the bipartisan coalition around global health.

Kay may raise this concern with you. As you know, we have clearly articulated our intention of keeping PEPFAR in the State Department.

It is being done by America's top ally, at least in part, by general omar suleiman, the intelligence chief.- turned unelected vice-president, an al jazeera critic.

2. But Europeans would not take offense at nice words said by you about Blair without an explicit endorsement. The rap against him is that he's ""Bush's poodle,"" and your positive comments would help erase that taint.

3. You can have a member of the press ask you about the Austrian comment about Blair or simply about the EU presidency.

Wyden discussed a market consolidation trigger - a proposal that if there were three or fewer plans in an area, a public plan would be triggered. He also envisioned (and Senate Finance is assuming) state based exchanges so that there would be 50 state exchanges, instead of one national exchange. However, and this is all hush, hush, Senate Finance is considering a cost-based trigger; so if insurance premiums go up more than x%, a public plan would be triggered as a break on costs. I came up with the cost trigger versus the market consolidation trigger, because that trigger will be hard for the insurers to avoid, if set properly. And of course, they just promised savings, so it can hold them accountable. (But to be clear, I am pushing hard for the public plan; I just came up with that idea to strengthen the other side.) Of course, all of this is super secret. I think we could have a national public plan that is operating in several states where the trigger goes off. It will be tricky but it's doable. And it could be combined with a state option, so that if it's lowering costs, states will want to do it to give their citizens a lower cost choice.

But look, we were hoping to have a trigger in the end game, and now are dealing with it now, which is a problem.","2","2","2","2","3","2","1","1","3","2"

After going through things briefly with her this afternoon, there is one request that we have on the substantive front. We'd like to get (at whatever classification level is appropriate) really two additional meaty papers for her meetings with Netanyahu and Liberman. These would supplement the material in her book. We are aware that these will be tough meetings, but we also view them as a good opportunity to also cover a lot of ground. There are a lot of issues not in the current papers that could come up: from Israel in the UN system, to Iran, to settlements, to the current Temple Mount crisis, to the Israel and Palestinian economies, to the security barrier, etc.. Tom and his team may have additional issues they'd like her to raise as well. She'd like to be over prepared for these meetings and realizes that the SBU format has not given your team the latitude to get that done.

In these two cases could we get classified supplemental for her BCLs with lots of background, TPs, etc. Please blow off any length requirements, etc. — longer and more comprehensive is better in this case.

He then asked a series of questions: - Missile Defense and the preamble - Why the Bomber counting rule change - Why not a range (ie: 1700-2200) vs a hard number - If asked about tactical nukes. ..why didn't we try to cover it in this treaty - Asked about the negotiation details on telemetry/verification, ""Did we lose anything?""

In addition, at the end he asked about the decision to release actual stockpile numbers, Powell is a fan of a bit of ambiguity. He and the VCJCS briefly discussed China (simplified version: Cartwright expressed his concern/China as a threat, Powell sees China in a slow build mode with lots of obstacles to overcome).

Thanks for the note back on this. I have an idea but I need to give you a little more background. I follow the Amelia Earhart search details closely and EAP has assisted the search team these last three years.

This was written up in the Times and you can google it. Most treated this find as suggestive by highly circumstantial.

The photo and the possibility of an airplane is a decisive clue. The plane was specially made and designed by Lockheed and it has a cast aluminum engine weighing almost a ton. It will be not too far from that photo area if it's there.

"C05776954_2","","All, Below is an email from Sy Hersh saying he is now ready to write a story for the New Yorker claiming that the US and its allies have ""no empirical evidence of any nuclear weaponization facilities in Iran."" He will also deal with alleged special ops and the ""newly proposed NIE"" (which he says doesn't have USG unity). He seems to conclude that ""it is also a fact that Iran just may be telling it the way it is when it says — as it has forever—that they are not interested in the bomb."" Like many of Herth's sensationalist and inaccurate pieces, this one may cause a stir, and it could give ammunition to Iran in the months ahead. I pass this on for situational awareness and early warning. Unless otherwise instructed, I don't plan to respond to him. By the way, his reference to ""our last chat"" was when I called him to say that his Pakistan piece about a year ago — claiming that Pakistani generals were sharing with us information about the locations of Pakistani nuclear weapons so that we could gain control over them in a crisis — was totally inaccurate, irresponsible, and very damaging to U.S. interests. That was just before I called his editor to say the piece amounted to journalistic malpractice and was far below New Yorker standards.

We have had good news on the emergency flooding situation in Mexico on two fronts.

First, it finally stopped raining, water has receded, and there is land access to areas that previously could only be reached by air. USAID and GOM specialists flew over the affected areas today and confirmed that the change in conditions obviates the need for U.S. helicopter support. Road access will be more efficient and cheaper. The receding waters will allow people to start the process of reconstruction more quickly. SEMAR and the Federal Police can provide air support as needed under the changed circumstances.

Second, President Calderon confirmed to his cabinet, and Secretary Espinosa confirmed it, that he was committed first and foremost to doing what is best for the population, and if that entailed the use of U.S. military helicopters, then he was ready to work with the United States to provide access to Mexican airspace. I reviewed the change in field circumstances with Secretary Espinosa. She called me back later to affirm that she had spoken with President Calderon, and the President was appreciative of the lengths to which the United States had gone to work with Mexican counterparts to plan for a helicopter deployment. This kind of open engagement with the Mexican cabinet in support of using U.S. military helicopters as part of a humanitarian relief effort is unprecedented.

The GOM will be conveying its thanks more formally — both from the Administration and the Governor of Nuevo Leon. Mission Mexico will also do an after action review to capture lessons for the future.

"C05789258_0","","DISCLAIMER: This is probably a LOT more than you bargained for, but since you asked...

I think there were two main reasons you didn't like what are now the two old new berrys:

1) You didn't like the physical changes in the new models as compared to your longtime berry (one was absurdly large, both had touchpads instead of trackballs, etc)

2) Less obvious, you didn't like Blackberry's most current operating system - its software interface that gives it its look and feel to the user - which came installed on the new devices. In that you are not alone. Blackberry has taken a lot of grief over it from users and critics. I can't stand it.

So without having actually seen your latest new old berry, I'm guessing that the reason you like it is the familiarity of the device coupled with the familiar operating system. It's just like the old one. If not identical, awfully close.

Problem is, one of the very few upsides of the new operating system is the incorporation of the emoticon chart with the texting feature.

So you're in a bit of a Catch-22: to get back what you like you're going to have to revert to what you didn't like meaning, the latest operating system.

I recently became the CEO of Suicide Prevention Initiatives, the leading nonprofit addressing suicide through direct treatment and research. Suicide is the 8th major cause of death worldwide. SPI's work extends to LGBT youth, college campuses, and rural China and Vietnam. Over the next year, because of the need, SPI is launching a number of initiatives to treat Iraq and Afghanistan veterans suffering from Post Traumatic Stress and at risk for suicide.

Today, we now lose more of our young men and women in uniform to suicide than to combat. The stresses of returning home, often isolated from your band of brothers and sisters, marked by visible and invisible scars of war, to a nation not at war is an incredible burden to bare. We lose a service member to suicide approximately every 36 hours. In July, the Army alone lost 33 active and reserve soldiers. And the VA estimates approximately 18 veterans take their lives everyday. As more American troops return home and transition from war zones, this issue will continue to require our urgent attention.

On overall Afghanistan coverage, Embassy London is also concerned. We engage every day on this topic, either through briefings, interviews with policy makers coming through (recent highlight was a brilliant interview by Newsnight's Paxman with Holbrooke), facilitating media enbeds and reporting on the ground, making and pushing out speeches, discussions with journalists. We work closely with colleagues in Kabul, NATO and elsewhere. We get decent support from Washington and other field elements, although sometimes we struggle to get basic information from our colleagues, such as total number of troops involved in Operation Moshtarak.

One challenge for us is that we are tightly bound here in the public mind to HMG on this issue. And in the run-up to the UK election, some media outlets see criticism of the effort in Afghanistan as an effective way to campaign against Gordon Brown. Sometimes they ricochet a shot off of us in order to hit the main target. The Murdoch outlets, of which the Times is one, have a headline goal of getting Cameron elected, which is what told me outright earlier this week. This cartoon was possibly one of those ricochet shots, but that sure doesn't excuse it. Thanks for your note—I really appreciate you thinking of us.

The CBC worked for years before Aristide was taken out of office to have funds released that had been approved by the Inter American Development Bank. The US was the main obstacle to having those funds released and so the embracing of democracy has not lifted the condition of the Haitian people. And once again the world seems to be waiting on us. Chairman Conyers promised to bring the President to Haiti, but Secretary Clinton will be a great sign of our support.

The government seems to be looking for somewhere aound $1.5 billion from donors (am not sure President Preval and the PM are on same page on this). This is the amt I gleaned from discussions with the pres who said their losses from storms in 2008 were about $lbil.

President Preval' priorities. Are roads, electricity and investing in agriculture in 3 areas he has identified. The PM speaks more of schools and healthcare which are also big needs

Elections are next week and as of when we were there Lavalas had no candidates. To the best of my understanding there are 3 offshoots all wanting to participate under that banner and the leadership is not clear.

This is perhaps info you already have. I am very happy to see that Secretary Clinton is going and I hope this will mean increased and sustained support.

The Palestinians will ask the United Nations Security Council to unilaterally recognize an independent Palestinian state within the 1967 borders early next month, chief negotiator Saeb Erekat was quoted as saying by the Maan News Agency Wednesday.

Speaking to reporters in the West Bank town of Jericho, Erekat said the Palestinians are waiting for Bosnia to take the presidency of the Security Council before submitting the proposal.

"C05783571_2","","I've been in touch with many of the participants in today's Arab League meeting. I'll attempt to summarize here. There is a real sense of accomplishment among those with whom I spoke, a feeling that they showed the AL can be relevant and respond to an Arab crisis and Arab public opinion. As one told me, ""we exceeded expectations."". They all seem tired, too, at what sounds to be an exhausting and rather historic debate Syria, unlike Libya, is a heavyweight in Arab politics. Remarkable that the AL followed through. That said, this giddiness shouldn't disguise the fact that there's not much in the way of implementation beyond the suspension of Syria's participation in AL bodies.

The FMs seem to agree that there were three primary accomplishments (and I'm not quoting the communique here but what they saw as significant):

-- agreement to suspend the participation of Syria from all AL bodies, starting November 16. The suspension lasts until the SARG fully implements the AL initiative. (More below on this date.)

-- agreement that AL SecGen al-Araby would work on plans to protect civilians, including by looking at how to cooperate with Arab and international human rights groups (again, more below). He is expected to present ideas for the 11/16 meeting in Rabat.

-- call on Arab states to withdraw ambassadors from Damascus, although with a caveat that such decisions are the sovereign right of each state.

According to what I heard, the sanctions language was more or less a place holder reference. There is nothing in the

language to implement this. The Arabs will discuss this again when they meet on 11/16 in Rabat, but I didn't get theB1

sense that they expect to implement formal sanctions. Still, the mention of sanctions is useful.

The thrust of the piece is that there is a great deal of concern about growing Iranian influence in Latin America — talk of investments, projects and so forth — but so far very little has actually appeared. In other words, the Iranians are talking a good game but not delivering. It is within this context that Mary Beth picked up on the comment by the Secretary of this large embassy in Manangua that It turns out is not under construction, at least not yet.

On the record, I said that the Secretary picked this up from one of her counterparts from the region during a bilateral. If it turns out that is not happening, that's good news. The Iranians see themselves as the big winners in the second Gulf War. They are trying to extend their influence, particularly in their own region, but elsewhere where they see possible openings.

"C05797133_1","","Dear Madame Secretary,

Thank you so much for the opportunity to work at WHA with 100,000 Strong. I so appreciate the chance to team up with a great group and launch an effort which will have long term impact. As you may have heard, we have joined with Partners of the Americas and NAFSA... so that the initiative will have a sustained and productive life. Steve Vetter of Partners described how you had worked with Partners in Arkansas to establish student exchanges in Latin America. It is so fitting that we now build on that experience.

I was in Mexico City two weeks ago as part of your effort to increase the number of women businesses who can access contracts from corporations and government. People were so enthusiastic...again thanks to your leadership. Funny, the IBM representative told me that my father had started a similar program with IBM for minority businesses in 1968!

About ten days ago, I had lunch with Vince Panvini of the Sheet Metal Workers---where we sang your praises, recalled old campaigns and dreamt of another one!!

I know you hope for some rest---well deserved. Then, I look forward to joining another effort to take you to your rightful place!!

With all good wishes and great gratitude,

Kathleen

21' Century Defense Priorities

This morning, President Obama and Secretary of Defense Panetta unveiled new strategic guidance that reflects our 2V century defense needs and secures America's leadership for the future. The Defense Department and State Department continue to work side-by-side to bring the full range of American assets to bear on our foreign policy. As the new strategy notes, meeting our challenges cannot be the work of our military alone. Diplomacy and development are equal partners with defense in our smart power approach to promoting American interests and values abroad, our economic prosperity, and protecting our national security.

This new guidance is a critical element in our integrated approach to strengthening American leadership in a changing world. It enhances the capabilities and relationships we need to lead and meet our responsibilities for years to come. And it promotes our strategic priorities, including sustaining a global presence while strengthening our focus on the AsiaPacific region; deterring our adversaries and fulfilling our security commitments; investing in critical alliances and partnerships, including NATO; combating violent extremists and defending human dignity around the world; and preserving our ability to respond quickly to emerging threats. As we move forward with this strategy, we will continue to consult our allies and partners to address our shared concerns, seize new opportunities, and bolster global stability.

I look forward to continuing the close partnership between the Departments of State and Defense as we work together to realize President Obama's vision for the security of the United States and its people.","3","3","3","3","3","2","2","1","3","2"
"C05783819_0","","FYI — Lavrov gave a speech today with the following key themes:

— The US needs to respect democracy and rule of law internationally. (i.e., respect the rules and provide others more of a say.)

— A Europe truly whole should have no dividing lines.

— Core principles for US-Russian relations should be indivisibility of security, mutual respect, and taking into account the other side's views. We are still waiting to see US rhetoric translated into practical deeds.

- Russia's proposed European Security Treaty would merely formalize what previous agreements have averred—e.g., that no one should attempt to increase their security at the expense of others. In this respect, missile defense embodies cores issues at the heart of EST.","2","1","1","1","2","2","1","2","2","1"

"C05781934_0","Saif","You had asked what the indictment has on Saif. Much of it is from before the revolution. But the basic thrust is this: ""Muammar Gaddafi issued orders to his subordinates integrated within the State structure, including Saif AI-Islam Gaddafi and Abdullah Al-Senussi, who espoused and executed Muammar Gaddafi's plan which led to the commission of the crimes described in the Application. Both Saif AI-Islam Gaddafi and Abdullah Al-Senussi control relevant parts of the State apparatus and Security Forces: Saif AI-Islam Gaddafi, acting as Muammar Gaddafi's de facto prime minister and exercising control over finances and logistics, and Abdullah Al-Senussi, acting as head of the Military Intelligence and exercising control over certain security organs.""

Put simply, the ICC demonstrates that Saif had control of the Security Apparatus and that the Security Apparatus perpetrated criminal acts. They further demonstrate that he was aware of these acts. They therefore conclude that there are reasonable grounds for an indictment.","3","3","3","3","1","2","1","3","3","2"

U/S Sherman asked that I share the good news with you: the bridging text tabled by Amb.

Importantly all, including French and Russians, have agreed to co-sponsor.

Two items to flag for you from the S-Patriota call this morning. First, on Alan Gross, Patriota raised your name and asked if you had been speaking with Marco Aurelio Garcia about a possible deal involving the some aspect of the Cuban Five for Alan Gross. S was clear on the distinction between Gross as a development worker and the Cuban 5 as an espionage issue, and said there was no deal. She did describe the humanitarian ways we have worked with the Cuban 5 (e.g. visas for family members, moving one to Florida so his mom can visit). Second, Patriota said that President Roussef is traveling to Haiti soon, and he asked for S' thoughts. In the course of the conversation, S said she would send him a nonpaper on Haiti.

"C05776686_1","","I am a former British diplomat. In the course of my former duties I helped to coordinate multilateral action against a brutal regime in the Balkans, impose sanctions on a renegade state threatening ethnic cleansing, and negotiate a debt relief programme for an impoverished nation. None of this would have been possible without the security and secrecy of diplomatic correspondence, and the protection of that correspondence from publication under the laws of the UK and many other liberal and democratic states. An embassy which cannot securely offer advice or pass messages back to London is an embassy which cannot operate. Diplomacy cannot operate without discretion and the protection of sources. This applies to the UK and the UN as much as the US.

In publishing this massive volume of correspondence, Wikileaks is not highlighting specific cases of wrongdoing but undermining the entire process of diplomacy. If you can publish US cables then you can publish UK telegrams and UN emails.

My question to you is: why should we not hold you personally responsible when next an international crisis goes unresolved because diplomats cannot function.

I am sorry for bothering you, but I wanted to make sure that this had the highest escalation. I have already emailed people in the USMC because I think the whole way the United States reacted to this was poorly thought out. I know (from my prior service) the Afghan people, and the reason that I know the following is because it is commonly known through the News Media.

Wahhabi oriented charities and Madrases in Saudi Arabia have been well funded by the Saudi Royal Family and the more Radical Clerics have purchased professional book printing equipment and have printed Qurans that as you already know have adulterated or bastardized the solumm text of the orthodox writings and have supplemented radical sayings to attack Jews, Israel, and Infidels including Americans. Instead of going public with our leadership looking incredibly stupid and contrite before the Afghan People and Arab Language Press outlets, I would suggest that we be brutally honest that someone in Saudi Arabia committed blasphemy, re authored the Quran in such a way as if someone thought they were smarter than Allah. That the United States regarded this as an unholy abomination and decided to burn it as it should because after all this was an unholy propaganda tool for extremists. You say this, and they will accept that, rather than we merely screwed up one more time!

One thing to note, none of the kids mentioned the state department or usg. Only Jessica Vaughan who is at the center for immigration studies and has long been a critic (and was a former junior FSO) mentioned State with incredible disdain and explicit culpability. They used a bunch of broil of S without saying anything to me, despite my grilling, but the broil is public footage and it never blames S if anything it shows her ""fix it now"" mentality and that this can't be tolerated. They also continually said that the vast majority have great experiences. Both Brian and Kate said that in the live follow-up on the piece.

The U.S.-China dialogue on Latin American issues began in 2006 during the Bush administration, led by Tom Shannon, and recurred in 2007 and 2008. My trip to China will be the first such dialogue to take place during the Obama administration

China is now a top-three trading partner of many Latin American countries and is in fact the number one trading partner of Brazil, as well as being a donor member of the Inter-American Development Bank and observer at the Organization of American States.

The purpose of these talks is three-fold: to inform the Chinese of our policy priorities in the Americas, to learn about their views on the region, and to explore potential areas of cooperation in the areas of economic and social development. In addition to the formal meetings with government officials, I will also be meeting with Latin American diplomats, Chinese academics and private sector groupings.

- loading the busses at Ashraf took a very long time due to (a) MEK-instigated arguments about cargo and general stalling and; (b) GOI searches of people and baggage, which seemed excessive.

At UN head Kobler's request, I called MEK's Mohaddessin to unstick the process.

"C05788450_0","Quilliam","You had asked about the Quilliam foundation. Here is some basic background:.

The Quilliam Foundation is a London-based think tank that tries to nuance government approaches to Muslims and to separate Islam and Islamism, which it sees as a root cause of terror. Quilliam seeks to encourage a Western version of Islam, on the premise that there are more Muslims living in the Western world than the Middle East.

So far they have many focused on publications, reports, and media hits. Critics point out that while certain organizations, like Active Change, have positively engaged British Muslim communities, Quilliam has focused more on media efforts that spotlight the problem of extremism rather than actually countering it. They were, apparently, quite favored by the Labour Government of Gordon Brown, but have fallen out of favor, despite high hopes, with the Conservative Government.

Two of Quilliam's three founders, Maajid Nawaz and Rashad Zaman Ali, were at one point members of Hizb ut-Tahrir, a long-standing pan-Islamic organization seeking to re-establish the Caliphate (but not a designated terrorist organization). Ed Hussein, its third founded, is currently a senior fellow at CFR.

Police officer Sardar Shah says the driver of the bus lost control Wednesday while driving on a mountain road, and the bus veered into a ditch in the Batagram district of North West Frontier Province. He says three children are among the dead. Shah blamed the accident on the driver's speeding as he went into a sharp turn on the road. Such accidents are common in Pakistan, where roads are often poorly maintained and drivers regularly disregard traffic rules.

"C05782458_1","","Jake, I hope this helps. I consulted with USUN and AF to fact check this:

The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) has given the UN Mission in Cote d'Ivoire (UNOCI) a very clear chapter 7 mandate. UNSC Resolution 1933 (June 2010) is the most recent confirmation of this. UNOCI's mandate includes the responsibility to ""protect civilians...within its capabilities and...in high risk areas of deployment,"" monitor the arms embargo, facilitate the flow of humanitarian assistance, and other responsibilities. Last week, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), in which Nigeria is a driving force, released a communiqué that called on the UNSC to strengthen UNOCI's mandate. However, our view and the view of the UK and France is that the UNSC has already given UNOCI the strongest mandate possible. It's UNOCI's rules of engagement (ROE), which are drafted by the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operates (DPKO), and not the Mission's UNSC mandate that should be strengthened and clarified. We're working in New York to push the DPKO to clarify UNOCI's ROE.

AF and USUN's view is that UNOCI should do a better job in carrying out the civilian protection component of its mandate. USUN is working with the French to make this clear in the current UNSC resolution that is being negotiated in New York today, including inserting language that ""stresses [the UNSC's] full support given to UNOCI to use all necessary means to carry out its mandate to protect civilians."" Nigeria, as a non-permanent member of the UNSC, is an active part of these discussions. To help enable UNOCI, we are working with other donors to train and equip new troop contributors to bring UNOCI's force level from its current deployment of approximately 9,000 soldiers to the mandated level of 11,150.

Both Secretary Clinton and Secretary Geithner gave excellent remarks, both in tone and substance. I had an opportunity for an exchange with Hillary after the dinner and it was good to catch up with her given the tumultuous sequence of events over the past few weeks — and frankly just to give her a hug and squeeze her hand.

"C05765689_1","","Just a brief update on the Senate health care debate.

The Senate will take its first vote on health care legislation Saturday night now that Leader Reid seems to have secured the requisite votes to invoke cloture. The vote to invoke cloture will double as a vote on the motion to proceed, allowing senators to head home for Thanksgiving recess following the 8 p.m. vote.

If cloture is invoked, Reid would immediately call up his bill as a substitute amendment to a House measure that will serve as the shell for the motion to proceed vote. Senator Coburn had threatened to require the clerk to read the 2,000page bill following the vote on the motion to proceed, but Reid will call up the bill by number only, which prevents a reading.

Whether Reid has the votes to break the filibuster Saturday hangs on three Democrats: Senators Lincoln, Landrieu, and Ben Nelson. All three say they are undecided, but appear to indicate they are leaning toward voting in favor of cloture.

Reportedly Landrieu has been using her leverage to attempt to change the bill as it moves forward and won a particularly sweet deal that could bring billions to Louisiana. Following 2005's Hurricane Katrina, Louisiana saw an increase in per capita income, which led to a significant drop in federal Medicaid funding. Reid included language in the bill that will increase funding by 50 percent of the total decrease.

You will recall that Senator Snowe was the only Republican to vote in favor of the Finance bill, but said she has too many concerns with Reid's version to support the cloture vote Saturday.

Earlier this week, the CBO scored the Reid bill. The CBO estimates the total cost of the legislation is $848 billion.","3","3","2","3","3","2","3","2","3","3"

"C05792398_1","","What we've picked up as of around 10:30 pm Wednesday evening:

Shots were fired in the neighborhood of the Cabinet Secretary General's building, down the street from the PM's office in Ramallah. Everyone in the neighborhood reportedly heard the shots at around Iftar (around 7:45 pm here).

The policemen/guards who were there gave conflicting reports to superior officers who are now investigating. One guard said that he fired several bullets because passengers in a speeding car opened fire towards the building. Another claimed it was accidental discharge. All policemen/guards around the two buildings are being questioned.

Sense here is that it was a policeman covering up his negligent discharge, which we hear is not uncommon. Apparently, two years ago, in an accidental discharge incident, a policeman killed himself.

As Ambassador Mitchell had mentioned in the meeting a few weeks ago, Burma's Minister of Health is coming to Washington. He is coming much earlier than expected (we originally thought May) so we will have to work quickly with JHU to provide a robust program and food for thought for the Minister to take home to Burma.

JHU invited the Minister and controls most of the schedule; however, we would like to have a strong USG component as well and would like to work with your office in putting together a comprehensive program. I would appreciate your assistance in identifying key interlocutors, clinics, programs, and ideas to shape the schedule. I think we'd like to focus the Minister's attention on what is possible for Burma rather than show him fancy, expensive medical equipment that requires extensive maintenance, training, and 24 hours of electricity to operate.

Ambassador Mitchell is also interested in providing the Minister with ""tangibles"" if possible, perhaps offers of assistance (in line with any restrictions we have), capacity building, and training opportunities. We'd like to work with your office on this idea.

As part of the India engagements next week, Wendy will host ""Foreign Office Consultations"" with the Foreign Secretary, and I will participate in that. The Foreign Secretary specifically requested this after my trip to India, He wanted to continue the discussion we had on energy security issues.

There is an Energy Dialogue that DOE has hosted with India since 2005. It precedes the Strategic Dialogue. I could try to create a working group under that to continue our exchanges on Energy Security, but I am not sure that this is the best course.

Ambassador Frank Wisner's diplomatic career spans four decades and eight American presidents. In addition to posts in Algiers, Vietnam, Tunisia and Bangladesh, Ambassador Wisner served as Secretary Rice's special representative to the Kosovo Status Talks in 2005 and as Ambassador to Zambia, Egypt, the Philippines, and India.

We touched on a range of topics — which can be summarized by topic — climate change (Hayes feels that DOI is the leader on adaptation questions), arctic and biodiversity(2010 is the year of biodiversity). I also mentioned that DOI may want to look at some of our bilateral efforts, specifically strategic dialogues, to see where their interests and expertise might be.

The issue we spent the most time on was the Arctic — Sec Salazar is very interested in the region and engaging his international counterparts. Hayes mentioned that Sec Salazar is very interested in the ""science"" of the Arctic and of the course the climate change impact. DOI is very anxious to do something international. A possible opportunity could build on the fact that DOI is opening regional centers (located at universities) around the country to integrate their applied science efforts — e.g. data bases, surveys, monitoring stations, etc. One such center is opening in Alaska. It may be possible to set up some kind of a network with Arctic partners who have similar — ""applied science centers"". We agreed to explore such an idea.

Finally, Arias was very pleased that Hugo plans to call in the candidates to get them to go to Micheletti and say that an election outside the San Jose process is of dubious legitimacy.

I told Arias that the Secretary is very strong in her commitment to the San Jose process and Arias asked that I give her his warm regards.

The situation in the Ivory Coast is fluid and may be at a tipping point.

"C05760166_1","","I have to say that this argument that the Taliban are ok to ignore is dangerous morally and politically.

The argument at the time was that harboring terrorism was the same as launching terrorism and that those who harbored would be held responsible. This also had long term deterrence value against regimes that would outsource the dirty work.

To now even consider giving the Taliban a pass after harboring terrorists who committed direct attacks on new York and Washington defies the imagination. This wasn't some embassy bombing but a strike right at our country. The white house or congress barely escaped destruction. Saddam Hussein wasn't connected to al Qaeda but the Taliban surely were without question.

And Teheran and north Korea are watching carefully, gauging how much resolve the us has in stopping their plans. If the us lets the Taliban off the hook then they certainly can conclude it will do nothing beyond sanctions with them. And essentially letting karzai twist in the wind also suggests the us does not live up to it's commitments, giving pause to those who would help the us.

Politically, this is also quite dangerous. Obama maintained througout the campaign and the start of his presidency that this is the one to fight and backing down here makes him and the administration vulnerable to losing moderate support and seeming weak and indecisive. A single terrorist incident would be blamed on the admin. failing to do the job right.

I could go on and on with other negative ramifications but of all the options it appears to me any strategy that says fighting the taliban are not in the strategic interests of the us should be doa.","3","3","2","3","3","2","2","2","2","2"

The international media team in PA pulled together an effective package of interviews today to support our Libya messaging:

• Dubai Hub Director, Jen Rasamimanana, did Arabic-language interviews on Al-Jazeera, Al-Arabiya, and Al-Hurra that ran live this afternoon/evening Middle East time. These come on top of Libya-focused interviews she did late last night with MBC and Al-Arabiya, and a raft of interviews she did in Cairo, and her deputy Dan Ernst did in Tunis, in conjunction with the Secretary's visits there.

• With nice collaboration with DOD, we arranged for OSD U/S Michele Flournoy to do a slate of interviews from the State Department mezzanine:

BBC World Service and domestic news - live (The two channels are joined today for continuous coverage of Libya story);

-- BBC Arabic television — live; -- BBC World Service radio for their flagship current affairs program for international audience; — BBC domestic UK radio — taped for their top news program, airing tomorrow; -- Al Arabiya — live for their early evening newscast.

• Starting tomorrow, we'll stop programming DOD voices in favor of lower-key State Department engagements. We want to ensure that the optic internationally is not of a U.S.-led military operation, but an international effort comprising Europeans and Arabs.

• The London Hub and RRU also provided terrific support with intensive Arab media monitoring throughout the weekend.

Of course this is predicate for targeted sanctions. There is a consistent thread in the challenges we face from a host of authoritarian (and totalitarian) military governments, sometimes loosely allied on an ad hoc basis--Iran, China, Myanmar, Venezuela, Cuba. This is nothing like the Cold War, but it's an idea worth exploring, not publicly discussing, but thinking about.

On Justice Jim, a couple of thoughts: I wish his tragic end were as politically conclusive as that of Edmund Ruffin, the Southern fire-eater and secessionist who was given the honor of firing the first shot at Fort. Sumter and upon hearing of Appomattox carefully sat himself down in his grand Charleston house and blew his brains out with a shotgun. Unfortunately, the evil Justice Jim did lives on--in the wild bigotry against Obama and even through the Supreme Court decision in the case of Citizens United, a group he helped galvanize to circulate the Whitewater hoax.

The only question seems to be whether those elections take place next month or later this fall. Everyone agrees that yesterday's election marks the end of the political party system that has governed Greece for decades, but what remains to be seen is how quickly a new, stable system emerges. Voters yesterday were clearly in the mood to punish the two main parties and reject ""politics as usual,"" but they did so either by choosing the extremes - the radical left, SYRIZA, and the neo-fascist Golden Dawn - or by abstaining (some also voted for minor parties that will not meet the threshold for entry into Parliament). The concern with holding elections again in just a month is that there will not be sufficient time for new, more moderate forces to emerge that will give people a clear and effective alternative to the extremes.

In the meantime, the Governor of the Central Bank has told me that there has thus far been no massive withdrawals of deposits from the banks, though he remains concerned that something could still trigger that. My EU colleagues here are trying to keep their heads low, but no one seriously believes the Eurozone countries are in any mood to renegotiate the terms of the bailout package for Greece.

But it was short on an action plan in terms of how america could capitalize on the moment and close the deal on many of the areas sited that were all ""in progress"". And could have used a prescription for america and Americans moving forward with what we need to do in this moment while domestic problems usually cause a pull back from international commitments and interest.

The news of the day really came from the question period when you hit the deficit, Mexican cartels and crazy Florida minister. (though admin took the bait on this, elevating him).

DETAILS

I initiated the telephone call to hsr at 1820 this evening.

- ri yong-ho visit. I told han that the usg's decision to approve a visa for ri's visit was a concrete demonstration of washington's intent to take steps to advance the relationship now that there was agreement on the denuclearization pre-steps. I noted, however, that rok ambassador lim sung-nam's attendance at the track II conference and request to meet there with ri had a natural bearing on the possibility of holding a meeting between ri and usg officials along the lines hsr suggested during his march 2 new york channel call. Per coordination with nss/asia, I told hsr that, (1) should vfm ri and amb lim meet in new york and (2) if the atmosphere in u.s.-dprk relations remained positive, I thought it was likely that the usg would consider positively sending nss korea director syd seiler and me to new york for a subsequent meeting with vfm ri. Hsr promised to convey the message to pyongyang immediately.

Ngo meeting in beijing. Separately, I informed hsr that I had received his e-mail from earlier this afternoon in which he conveyed pyongyang's proposal that u.s. ngo's involved in providing nutritional assistance to the dprk travel to beijing this week to conclude mou's with kapes (below). I told hsr that we were looking into the matter and that I would respond as soon as possible.

The court on Wednesday ruled the draft law is at odds with the interim constitution, which was issued in March to manage Egypt's transition to a civilian government. The court also said the new draft refers to Law 174/2005 of the abolished 1971 constitution.

The cabinet's legislative commission will review the draft law again to amend the articles in question, a senior government official told Al-Masry Al-Youm, but the review will delay the law, which was scheduled to be issued Sunday.

Local Development Minister Mohamed Ahmed Attiya, who is also a member of the legislative commission, said the

commission has not been officially informed of the court decision. Attiya told Al-Masry AI-Youm Wednesday that the draft law was not meant to be an amendment to the existing presidential elections law (Law 174/2005), but rather a new law consisting of 15 articles.

Some constitutional experts have recommended that the draft law be held until the new parliament convenes. ""The new law should have been compatible with the interim constitution; the violating articles have to be changed,"" said Atef al-Banna, a constitutional jurist.

But Hamdy Omar, a constitutional law professor at Zagazig University, said the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces' decision to submit the draft to the constitutional court was wise. He, too, recommended that the parliament's legislative committee be responsible for issuing the new law.

This morning the Orange Order that organizes Protestant parades voted to recommend acceptance of the recent Hillsborough Castle agreement on future parades by an overwhelming margin, 100-5. Rather than standing outside the parading commission, this vote is a sign of confidence by Unionism in the new agreement. 3.

Robinson and McGuinness, in fact, have already asked Empey to head a commission to make recommendations on making the executive work better. Robinson has told Shaun he is prepared to help Empey on the education issue, but not if he is unwilling to help on the peace process. Empey is also making a demand about who can be the justice minister that Shaun characterizes as ""insane."" The DUP and Sinn Fein have already created a process not to nominate someone from their respective parties to be justice minister to avoid putting in the post whose past is incendiary from Sinn Fein.

The current game plan is for Mr. Stevens to move no later than Wednesday from Malta to Benghazi. He will stage off shore initially for a one day visit during which he will have meetings with TNC interlocutors and get a sense of the situation on the ground. The goal of this one day trip is for him to lay the groundwork for a stay of up to 30 days.

He will be accompanied by a DS team, a staff member from Embassy Tripoli and the leader of USAID's DART team. With the support of Ambassador Cretz and Embassy Tripoli, Mr Stevens is in contact with TNC members on the ground in Benghazi and elsewhere; the team is also in contact with other diplomatic missions and NGOs in Benghazi. We expect to get support in particular from the Turks who have a consulate in Benghazi.

Mr. Stevens team has been in touch with Africom planners on the details of the mission. We have made the official request for support from OSD but have yet to get approval. Once we have that — and we hope that will be very soon -we will be able to move forward with the planning.

He is biting on the idea, though, of course, I can't guarantee anything. I've held out for him, but if he doesn't I can go to the Post or elsewhere. I have all I need on how the bill represents your campaign proposals and the like. The one question I wanted to ask you is about your idea on using FEHBP as a kind of a public option. I know you gave that to Rahm last August, and then mysteriously, it was in the Senate Finance package like a month later. None of us had ever discussed it in the policy process of the WH and I didn't hear of it in the Hill, so my assumption is that Rahm gave them your idea as a substitute for the public plan, which didn't have the votes. I know that was all top secret, but I'm wondering if I should give Robert some hint of this only because it was a linchpin to moving the bill. I would get him sniffing around on it, so he'd write it more as his own reporting discovery (hopefully). I know institutionally it was hard for Rahm to be pitching public plan substitutes. On the other hand, everything is leaking out now, including our super secret bill writing process in August. I can see the arguments on both sides of this, so wanted to check in on it.

"C05772446_2","","Hooray. 30th looks great (have to go to Edie's on the 29th for Gillibrand, but I can meet you after if that's better).

My other updates are:

With Gina, I'm hosting one of several dinner parties to welcome the new SEIU prez (yes a bit of an unstated message) to women leaders. I think Wendy S and Judy L are doing the others. It's another of Gina's great ideas.

And we're holding a fundraiser for Bennet on the 27th that is looking really good.

Finally, I did a brief intv with a Center for Public Service rep for their regular feature in the Post abt compelling leaders in the federal govnt. And this one will be about Kate Beale! Oh, and after confirming to do so with PIR, did a quickie recalling the thoroughly positive vibes and experiences of you and Laura Bush to our pal at Politico!!

Finally, finally, and hope I didn't say this already, I started yesterday am sending an anniversary greeting and ode to Team 9-11 Clinton to everyone there when we waited for you to come in (for the Mrs. Bush testimony coincidentally) and watched the 2nd plane, and of course the rest was our amazing journey together of work to be so proud of. I even included Ramon on the chain!!!

Impossible it now seems.

Done blabbing. Have a restful Sunday. Everyone, and I mean everyone despite what I recall about some, is singing your praises.","3","1","1","1","1","3","2","1","1","1"
"C05778486_4","","The package is with S specials, including an Action Memo. Cameron just called me, and asked us to let him know when it was signed, the earlier on Mon the better, as he's going to use it as the basis for pushback with the opening of Parliament tmw (eg, Gilani will speak at 7 am EST Mon to Parliament, but will hopefully not take the more adverse position on consular immunity). Given as well the Guardian piece which just broke in Pak (though Cameron said it had seemingly been downplayed in the local press, and was below the fold in both Urdu and English papers) , Cameron wants to do backgrounding with any journalists writing on this, and to have the Gilani letter out as a resource for that would be helpful to him.

(Asha is currently in Nairobi with her family.)

Ambassador Ranneberger has been working to secure hospital treatment for all of those being medevaced to Nairobi. The embassy will respond with as much assistance as it can to Asha's concerns.

"C05782457_0","arming the rebels, women, and small arms","Kavita Ramdas, until recently the head of the Global Fund for Women, said yesterday in my class in Pton that when the Global Fund sent out its annual survey to all their grantees re most important issue facing women in the world, they got three standard answers — poverty, access to education, and violence against women — and two first-time answers: 1) the increasing militarization and danger of their environments due to the flood of small arms; and 2) the issues already being caused by climate change (desertification, salination, degradation of topsoil, etc.). Sending arms into Libya will make it a more dangerous place to live and work at the most fundamental level, unless we're only planning to send rocket launchers. This is exactly the kind of issue where we never make the nexus b/w the demands of statecraft and women's lives — resulting state of society. AMS","3","3","2","3","1","1","2","2","2","1"
"C05739879_1","","I called PM el-Keib this morning to get his take on what we were all hearing about TNC final decisions to dismiss the government, etc. I told him that after the British Ambassador and I had spoken to him and Jalil on Sunday, we had hoped that these public skirmishes would end and that the government could focus on security and the elections. The PM said that he had in fact met with Jalil on Monday and agreed to work together for the good of the nation. On Tuesday, the PM had met with several Council members and had brought along proposed changes in some of the ministerial portfolios. He sensed there was agreement from the Council members present and thought he had succeeded in quelling the public discontent. Unfortunately, he continued, more public threats, etc. were issued and by Wednesday evening he had had enough. That prompted his critical remarks in a press interview demanding that the TNC stop interfering in the government's business and let him and his government do the work they needed to do without all this negative background noise. He told me that we should not be concerned about last night's ""rumors"" and that he would continue to work to end these fratricidal disputes. For his own role, he said he would be just as happy to give up his post if matters came to that We will continue to try to reach out to other contacts today to see if in fact the Council does intend to act against the government. But while the PM is clearly frustrated, he also seemed to believe that the current strife will not result in any major shake-up, at least for the time being.","2","3","2","3","1","1","2","2","1","1"
"C05765100_1","","Department of State Ranks High as Employer for HBCU Students and Alumni

Washington, DC October 26, 2009

In the current edition of HBCU Connect, the Department of State placed among the top five employers for Historically Black Colleges and University (HBCU) students and alumni. The Department of State is the highest-ranking Federal agency, listed under first-ranked McGraw-Hill, second-ranked Continuum Health Partners, and third-ranked State Farm.

HBCU Connect's ranking of best employers is based on the following criteria: HBCU student and alumni recruitment, brand penetration in HBCU communities, relationship with HBCU organizations, consistency in outreach efforts, types of positions made available, and messaging used to reach audience.

It is worth noting that the Department of State ranked:

"C05784364_6","","Ambassador Siddique:

Great speaking with you today.

Per our conversation, below and attached is further background regarding the East-West Center itself and responsibility of Board Members.

As you know, the East-West Center, based in Honolulu, promotes better relations and understanding among the people and nations of the U.S., Asia, and the Pacific through cooperative study, research, and dialogue.

The 18 member board includes five members appointed by the Secretary, five appointed by the Governor of Hawaii, and five international members chosen by the Board itself. The Secretary's appointees serve for a three year term. The position does not require senate confirmation.

The Board meets twice per year in Honolulu, with several subcommittees on various initiatives.

Below is the link to the Center's website. I also attached a document sent to me by Dr. Morrison outlining responsibilities of Board members. http://www.eastwestcenter.orq/about-ewc/

Let me know if there's any additional information I can provide you.

Many thanks. Heather
