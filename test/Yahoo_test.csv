They seperated and divorced after 23 years.  My mom decided she didn't want to be married or have kids and left.  My dad tried everything to convince her to stay.  Turning his life and ours upside down to try to please her.  All I can say is think of your kids first.  If your wife wants to leave there is not really anything you can do.  Just let her know you love her and want to work things out.  The rest is up to her.  Just remember your kids are going through this too!

"text241PG","WHY DO people & HOW CAN I  get treated different (better or worse) because they are unique?","beef is this: we all have prejudism against us in one way or another. Some of us receive financial benefits from it which causes more praejudicium. According to some my sex is wrong,my skin color is wrong,I'm not sexy enough,not rich enough,or you name it. Who decides the group that gets $ benefits or more social graces, or more job opportunities? Because of what happened to them or their INDIRECT ancestors? Or because of their physical characteristics? I WANT IN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!","Qualified people never fail. Because when you qualify yourself for doing something perfect - whatever it is,  a carpenter or a doctor or a hairdresser or a farmer, your confidence level will be stable. You will not worry about other factors than the work you are qualified to perform. You will make it big. Abraham Lincoln was not a handsome man - see where he reached. Charlie Chaplin in my opinion is not a handsome man - see where he reached. You have so many millions of them unknown but are happy because they are good at doing what they got themselves trained. Just find out what you can do perfect even if it is cleaning garbage - a good cleaner will be respected for his job. Problem with humans are their inability to perfectly match their ability and expectation or to strike a balance between them.","2","2","1","1","1","2","3","2","3","2"
"text1059SC","why were adam and eve punished for eating the forbidden fruit if they didnt know what they were doing was wong","if there was no sin at that time how were theypunished and why?","They did know, they were told they could eat anything but the fruit from the tree of knowledge, and they were persuaded even though they knew what they had been told (just like a child who is told don't do that, but the child tries anyway at least once until he or she is punished - the punishment comes regardless if they know why, as they disobeyed).  What they did NOT know was that they were naked, but that came to them after the fruit of knowledge was eaten - which then made them afraid and they began their own punishment as well as the one their maker gave to them when he tossed them out of the garden and put a guard around the tree.  The snake gets a bad rap now because the one who talked the woman into it took on the form of a serpent - who btw had legs until he was punished for his part in the situation by having them taken away and then being told man would always despise him for what he had done.","2","2","2","2","2","3","3","3","2","3"

With all the work and bravery that has happen through the years in the Harry Pottor world, how can this be? What about the profecy? ""Neither can live while the other survives""?

I read that she may be interested in killing Harry off in order to prevent publication of less than worthy books years from now when she is no longer writing them...and she has had the last chapter of book seven written for years....before all the madness and success.  I care about what happens in the books...and of course I don't think anyone wants to see Harry die...and I dont think she would let Voldemort survive and not Harry, because that would just be letting evil win.

As soon as you get off the ship, there will be TONS of Volkswagen taxi cabs waiting for people to jump in.  We actually were able to hire one for 40.00 US the entire day, I believe like 6-8 hours we were there.  We negotiated this before we even got in the cab.  He took us on a tour of Mazatlan, shopping, to eat.  Anywhere we wanted to go.  He told us some history of the town.  He was really really  nice and spoke very good English.  If you can't speak Spanish.  Anyway, just a suggestion.

When I flew to New Orleans in 2004, I was told that you can't take pictures of federal buildings.  Furthermore, when I was in Baltimore, a travel guide informed me that I couldn't take any pictures in the airport there.  So can I take pictures of the Lincoln Memorial, Washington Monument, WWII Memorial or the White House?  I don't know for sure if I am going to D.C. next month, but if I have the chance to go, I want to make sure that I know where and where not I am allowed to take pictures.  Thank you in advance for your response.","When we were there we took over 200 pictures in 5 days. You can only get so close to the White House. We didn't get the tour but it is fenced and guarded quite well. Anything outside that fence is up to you. Some places we were not allowed to photograph were inside the Capital on the House floor (they actually take everyones camera away there), in the National Archives where there is a tattered flag on display, and the Declaration of Indepedence and the Constitution.  These last two could be photographed but with no flash.  They recommend you step out into the hallway and test fire your camera to make sure it is not going to flash as you only get one mistake and you are escorted out.  All the other monuments and such were fine.","2","3","3","3","2","3","3","3","2","3"

My other cousin had his bracelet taken by people who wore descent clothes! Everywhere in the world, there will be pickpocketeers, carnappers etc. Just be careful! Dont be showy.

Chances are, they're mostly concerned about your safety.  After you've found out their concerns, make every effort to allay their fears.  If you really want to go, tell them you'll call a couple times a day.  Let them know where you'll be, when you'll be there.  Tell them how it makes you feel that they won't let you go, but don't be accusatory.  Let them know you think their concerns are justified and that you understand.  Tell them they've done a great job rearing you, and that you appreciate the trust they've already placed in you.  The most important thing is not to *convince* them, but to get them to WANT to let you go.  If you try to convince them, you'll almost certainly fail.  To learn a great many things about getting what you want (and getting others to WANT to give those things to you), read the book referenced below.  Good luck!

What are some reasons why we could clash behaviors?","ok, I know the previous answer was meant to help you but in my experience yahoo horoscopes are a bunch of crap, many horoscopes on line tell you that you are compatible with anybody. April 20 would make him an aries/ taurus he is on the cusp which may work in your in advantage of your relationship. Taurus is known for being stubborn and bull headed and a libra can use artistic ways of working around this or it may ignite into a very abusive relationship because alot of libras have a temper like non other in the zodiac and most tauruses don't know how to respond to this without fighting. The aries side of him is spoiled and wants everything his way. In order to keep the libra balance you will naturally try to compensate. Some libras can do this beautifully while others can only tolerate it for so long. An aries is an infant when it comes to love and many times the libra will feel more like a mother or care provider than a significant other.","1","1","2","1","1","1","2","2","3","1"

I've always wondered why. I'm not sure if it has something to do with the British Empire or colonialism. Its just a question I had in mind. 

Anyone else noticed?","Probably because, their country is so filthy rich, they support them financially in every way, better, then Americans, can. It was the English, who discovered America!

Anyone know if that's true?","well... think of it this way... if you ever get in trouble, they will investigate you.. they will pull all of your credit records, bank statements, library records, school grades, medical records.. anything that you've done in your lifetime is in a record somewhere... there is nothing that you do that goes unnoticed... remember that.

Of course you become more knowledgable and experienced the older you get.  But if you have not been living the past fourty years of your life, what have you been doing? Children's memories and consciousness are not fully developed til they are five, and they will not use metacognition (thinking about thinking, or about what you know or don't know, about WHY you do certain things..) until age 11.  They often are exposed to more elements in high school and here they become more intelligent and open-minded.  Of course it does depend on the individual.","3","3","2","3","2","2","2","1","3","2"

1.  What do you think about the 2010 being held in South Africa?<br/>2.  Do you think our crime rate will go up?","1. I am extremely happy to see the first world cup on the African continent to be held in South Africa. I feel that it will work towards further integration and give everyone one more chance to show the world what South Africa is capable of achieving.

2. I do not think that the crime rate will go up in South Africa. It levelled off a few years ago and violent crimes are actually dropping. As the levels of wealth and education are rising, crime will, in my opinion, go down. I see no reason why the world cup would change that trend.","3","2","3","3","3","1","3","3","3","3"
"text1273SC","When is Hallowe'en night celebrated, and what is it's origin?","Is it true that it is also known as Amateur's Night?","Halloween began as Samhain, the celtic new year (end of summer, start of winter) when our world and the spirit world came very close and spirits were able to pass into our world (costumed trick-or-treaters). The spirits would mess with people's houses, so to appease the spirits, people would put food offerings out (trick-or-treat candy).  Also, they would try to scare the spirits away with frightening faces carved into gourds (jack-o-lanterns).

When the Catholic Church came along, they altered the native pagan festival of Samhain into All Hallow's Eve (the Church did this with many pagan rituals--May Day and the May Pole, Easter--which comes from ancient love goddess Ashtaroth, whose symbols were the rabbit and the egg).  The reason the Church altered the pagan festivals to fit Christianity was to convert the pagans; they figured the best way to do so was to make it seem like the pagan's lives weren't really changing...just some of the names.","3","3","3","3","3","3","2","3","3","3"

"text1143AH","I am hoping to get some of my first edition books signed by the authors.  Any recommendations on how to do it?","If they have no individual website and no longer need to do book signings.... what next?  I am specifically trying for Gabriel Garcia Marquez, John Irving, Joseph Heller, Wally Lamb, ...","For such successful, well-known writers, having your first editions signed will not be as simple as just sending it to them. Authors can be notoriously recluse, and sending a valuable first edition to their publisher or agent sounds a bit risky to me. In the book ""A Gentle Madness: Bibliophiles, Bibliomanes, and the Eternal Passion for Books"" by Nicholas A. Basbanes the author recalls meeting Joseph Heller and, while signing his book, Heller noted the value of the book and commented that he didn't even have a first edition of ""Catch-22"". Basbanes' book is very informative regarding book collecting, and I'd reccomend it to someone in your position.

Also, while writers of this caliber my not hold signings in bookstores, you should research literary festivals, like the New Yorker Festival. Maybe your writer is speaking on a panel discussion there. My advice would be to go and act like a groupie trying to get backstage at a rock concert. This tactic may or may not work, depending on your force of personality and the approachability of the author, but I'd give it a try.","3","3","3","3","3","2","3","3","3","3"

Hopefully, he will return soon safe and sound. However, your husband became a soldier because he wanted to actively protect his family and defend the principles he apparently holds very dearly. If your husband does not do his duty, he will feel like less of a man, like he has failed as a husband and provider. Your husband, and the many others currently serving, are continuing a proud legacy, which allows the US to remain the greatest country on earth. Unfortunately, it requires a great deal of sacrifice, which the family left behind bears the greatest brunt of. If it is any consolation, there is a lot of talk on various blogs regarding accelerated drawdown of US forces in Iraq by the end of calendar year 2006. If the new govt holds, violence should begin to abate soon.

I was crushed, like you, for the longest time I never thought that the pain would ever cease. When your ex calls you, it feels like a slap in the face and pain really starts to hurt, to me that is a crappy thing to do to someone, also bragging about how their life is going great. My advice to you, is that when you put your trust in we humans, more or less except for a few good people out there, they will let you down. Let me tell you how I got over it, I asked God for help. If you believe in God or not, that is your choice, but I can tell you personally, He will never let you down, and that He loves you aboundingly, like a cup under a waterfall, it keeps on overflowing.

First make a character in your head; find their personality, likes and dislikes, special relationships, etc. Then build off of that; what's so special about that person? Why are they in your story? After that, dramatise (sp?) and write your fool head off. Don't ever ask for ideas; to be truely passionate and put full emotion in your writing (which can only make it better) you need to do it yourself that way, you can say, 'Yeah. This is all mine.'

Strauss teaches that deception is the norm in political life, and that societies should be hierarchical - divided between an elite, who should and must lead, and the masses that must follow.  He also taught that religion is paramount for the masses alone, and that the elite not be bound by it.

In order to control the masses, their rights must be curtailed and controlled.  Privacy, and the free exchange of ideas, must be controlled.  Freedom and Liberty run counter to keeping the attention of the masses on their own immediate surroundings rather than on the political maneuverings that happen every day to shape their lives, and thus, their own private prisons.","1","3","2","2","1","3","1","2","1","1"

Then, they rolled the stones overland on smoothed logs.  No one knows for sure that this is the right theory, and there are plenty of other theories, including, but not limited to aliens, higher powers, and creatures from other dimensions.

As for the age of the pyramids, I believe that most Egyptian pyramids are between 3500 and 3000 years old.  Mayan pyramids seem to be slightly younger, possibly in the 2500 to 1500-year-old range.","3","2","3","3","3","3","2","2","3","3"

Hopefully the girl you like isn't shy, so try to make eye contact with her. This is often the single most important factor in knowing if you have half a decent chance with asking a woman out. If she does look back at you, try to maintain a few seconds of eye contact before casually gazing away and then approaching her. When you finally do approach her, be friendly and smile. Of course, say hi and introduce yourself. Discuss things that you both can relate to. Ask her questions about herself to show your interest in her and try to lead the conversation but let her do most of the talking. If you can get a woman to feel comfortable with talking to you, your chances of asking her to get some coffee later will likely increase. The rest is up to you. The more often you approach women, the better you will get. Practice makes perfect. Good luck.","3","2","2","3","2","3","3","2","3","3"

Philosophers that do try to live their life according to a philosophy are psychotics - much the same as religious people living their life based on a book, or psychiatrists living their lives and lives of others based on their limited theories. Because, let's face it, life is bigger than any book can comprehend - and that's a good thing, or we'd be dull and complacent.

Capital punsihment is what the perpetrator of horrible crimes needs to find justice in his life.

You do a terrible criminal act, you know for certain you are going to get the char - or lethal injection. All of the arguments against the death penalty presume that the guy who brutally knifed all of those people was sort of having a bad day and no one had ever really loved him. Maybe that is true, but loving the guy isn't going to stop him from killing more. A few people have even figured out that death - as th punishment for their crime - is the best thing they can do to pay for the horrible wrongs they did. In facing up to justice, a few are able to find redemption.

I know the anit-death penalty crowd has a zillion wondeful sounding arguments and that they think they are on the moral highground.

And if gazelle indeed does “just accept” is the animal any the less alive, happy, blessed, etc. Should we be no more inquisitive, why is it abhorrent to our species not to accept what is and endeavor to what could be?","I think it is the blessing of Mankind (and the curse) to be curious, and it is this curiosity which will discover to us, one day, the origin and purpose of the universe.

However, in many cases, it is probably just better to ""let it slide"", ""go with the flow"", ""chill out"", and just accept things.  For instance, it is probably best to just accept the death of a friend or loved one, instead of asking ourselves, to infinity, and to no purpose, ""why?""  This is a form of morbid self-hatred which our species perpetrates to no end, and a question which we probably couldn't comprehend the answer to if we had it.","3","2","2","3","3","3","2","2","2","3"
"text543SC","What do you tell a friend who nitpicks to much?","We are pretty good friends and I really dont want to hurt her feelings, but she will pick and pick at something I do like it is a personal offense against her. <br/>Advice on how to handle this without hurting any feelings or ending the friendship?","Every time she does this, maybe tell her that you're sorry for not being a more perfect friend. If she's your friend, she'll instantly assure you that she's not expecting you to be perfect. That opens the door to you discussing why this particular thing bugs her this much. This way, you both get to air your feelings in a way that's rational and friendly. You'll both learn more about each other this way. She might just be thinking that she's helping you, not realizing it's annoying you. I have a friend who's similar to this. She can't understand some things about me because she was raised differently than I was. I was raised by an alcoholic father and an unloving mother. She was surrounded by love, with no one smoking, drinking or cussing in her home. But, we love each other and I will do anything for her at any time of the day or night. If I know that I do something that annoys her, I try not to do it around her. When I slip, and she comments, I just apologize and move on. What I'm saying is that I've accepted her just the way she is. I think I understand her more than she understands me, and that's okay. But, having an open & honest discussion about why your particular ""thing"" upsets her is good and will make you both feel better that you've both dealt with it. <*)))><","3","2","3","3","3","2","3","3","2","3"

The Father is not the same person as the Son or the Spirit. They are three distinct persons who all comprise one God. We do not understand it because we have no concept of perfect union or perfect relationship. Since our birth we have lived in a world of broken relationships. The three members of the Godhead share an unbreakable bond of like thoughts, passions, joys, pains, affection, hate to such a degree that in one sense they cannot be separated. Jesus said, ""I can do nothing of my own, but what I see my Father do in heaven."" In other words, his greatest pleasure was in being like his Father. He had no desire to be independant. But they are distinct enough to communicate with each other. That is why only God really knows what it will take for unity to be realized on earth, he has been in a perfect relationship for all eternity.","2","3","1","2","2","2","1","3","3","2"

A child is totally defenseless against an adult. And I agree with the other statement about spending our tax dollars to keep killers alive. I think if someone did something to warrant the death penalty than they should not be allowed to sit on death row for decades with the victims familie's tax dollars pay for him/her to have three square meals a day, a roof over their head, exercice equipment, Tv's, DVDs, medical care.... And on top of that the officails worry about using a dirty needle when the time actually comes... Their gonna be dead in a few minutes anyway so what would it matter? Save those clean needles for hospital patients that haven't murdered someone. Just my opinion here , but I think people would be less likely to commit these acts if they were more afraid of what would happen to them. Anymore the death penalty is a cake walk for those monsters. Take them out into a field and kill them however they killed their victim.. In the case of multiple murders they should either pick the most violent one or choose a combination of elements from all and kill them that way instead of that sterile room with the sterile tubes and the sterile needle... or just tie them to a post out in the wilderness with a few superficial cuts on them and let the insects and animals have their way.","2","2","3","3","1","1","3","1","1","1"

Serious answers please, my thesis depends on it. ^!^","I think Confucianism is come down to us in the forms, mainly, of the collected sayings of him, as well as the philosophical writings and views on government.  You, know, I never really got into confucianism when I studied it in college in religious studies, but I remember I could find no fault in it.  It is barely discussed, it seems, but has the potential to transform the evil which exists in our world.  Confucius had the idea that there was a fundamental ""good"" within all people and that government must appeal to the good and thus transform the people into ones who would feel the shame before committing an evil act, thus feeling the punishment prior to the misdeed.  Confucius had a much higher opinion of basic human nature than most Western theologians, it seems.  I would offer this:  Let confucianism transform China first, something it has failed to do, though it is often held up as the pinnacle of all Chinese historical thought and culture.  Let it do that first, then the West will talk seriously with this movement.","3","2","1","2","2","2","2","3","3","3"

These people have to degrade you to make themselves feel better. Let them call you names, joke about how you function in the world, and laugh at your personality,etc., it's just their way of turning the spotlight away from themselves because they are afraid if you look too closely at ""them"", you may find a few flaws. If they would turn on their brights, they would realize everyone is different; has bad points and good points; and acceptance brings people closer.

"text1862SC","Should people have to work on Sundays? Why or why not?","I think that workers should not work on Sundays and the only places that should be open are places of worship, hospitals, and pharmacies. Places like grocery stores, gasoline stations, and restaurants should no be opened on Sundays so that workers can spend time with family & friends and so that they can also spend time and worship.","Religiously speaking I concur 100%.  The Bible states that our families, our slaves, and we should not work on the Sabbath day.  Now, slavery is not slavery as it was back then ... rather it is the common worker who gets paid wages.  Owners of stores who choose to remain open are sinning, and pressuring their workers to sin too.  The blame also gets spread to we, the consumers ... if we engage a business on the Sabbath day, are we not increasing the owners desire to remain open ---increasing the workers to work???  I try hard not to shop on Sunday, but it's so commonplace that I find myself doing this wrong.

Non-religiously, I believe that workers and owners need down time ... if we do not find time to silence our environment, and minds then we'll all go insane…we may already be there though.","2","3","3","3","2","1","1","1","1","1"

The rocks are great to walk around. The Queen Victoria building is a marvelous piece of architecture. The opera house is amazing especially if you are on the Manly ferry. While there you can go to the aquarium. I think the beaches are great. Overseas visitors get amazed at the blueness of the water. The olympic water park is also great for kids upto about 15....adults too if they are young at heart. I know all these because I come from Newcastle but am living in canada.

One of my dancers lost her dad shortly before our recital one year and I know she too had such a hard time still going on the stage as her father loved watching her dance.

Do you currently have an RV?  If you do it is a great way to go!  If you don't, do you want one?  It is generally pretty expensive to purchase one.  If you don't have one and don't plan to do much ""camping""  I would suggest renting a small trailer from U-haul, get a carrying case for the cat & stay at reputable motels.  I have been a ""full-time"" RVer for 27 years and I love it, so do my 3 cats.  But if it is going to be a one shot type of thing there are much less expensive ways to go.  It is not much more expensive to stay in a motel than it is to stay in an RV park.  Plus if you are not accustomed to driving a truck or school bus they can be difficult to handle at first.  A U-haul towed behind your car would be much easier.","2","2","3","3","3","2","2","3","1","2"

Think of bloated egos... This is the time that most Filipinos become hypocrites.

On the other hand, others become simply dumb without them knowing it like in the case of Manny Pacquiao's singing prowess, or lack of it.  Though his voice seems to be a can of sardines being torn apart as you have said, they tend to be very amused and mesmerized by his 'ability'.  The reason for that is simple.

Regardless of all my mixed feelings, we seem to stay really close. Why do I do this? What should I do?","Why don't you think it wouldn't work for you to be together? From my own experience, the very best of relationships start from the very best of friendships. I think you really like this guy as a little more than I friend. Do you? If he has a girlfriend right now, then I don't think you should do anything. Wait til he's single! You've written that you don't think he thinks of you in ""that way"". That could be because he feels the same way but doesn't know how you feel... I think you should wait til he's single, and then tell him, in a casual way, that you're starting to care about him as more than a friend, and ask him how he feels about that. Give him time to think it over. If he says cares about you only as a friend, then don't pursue the subject- it'll only end up eating away your friendship. Otherwise, take it from there. Go on a date or two, see what develops. I do think you should let him know how you feel, unless you are absolutely 100% convinced that there's no way you two could stay ""together"".

There may have been other laws, but I believe the one that had the greatest impact forbid Jews from owning land such as would be needed for a store.  As a result, Jews not only went into fiscal ""sinful"" occupations such as money-lending, but they also went into the medical professions.  Neither really needed a specific place for business.  Also, Jews had some knowledge of medecine from all the time they spent in the Middle East where people were pretty advanced in that stuff.  Christians at that time were generally using holy water and sacred relics as their medecines.  So the ill-treatment of the Jews left them with a reputation for fiscal and medicinal occupations that they still have today.","3","2","3","3","3","3","3","3","1","3"
"text1425AH","When will the United States no longer be a world power?","I don't mean this from an anti-American perspective.

All nations have their ups (and we, Americans, are certainly having one now) and their falls. Thats why I want to ask this question in History.

I can think of two scenarios, a rise to dominance by China (possible, but not inevitable), or a fall caused by internal US problems. Personally I think something internal will eventually get us.

What do you think?","To nietzsche: don't you think if it came to that, it would be China that was screwed?  We have material wealth exported from the Chinese industrial sector; they would be holding worthless bonds.  The downside in the crash of the bond market here is that we would no longer be able to borrow to cover our debt; but then, neither would they, since so much of the value of their national wealth is based in holding US bonds that would become worthless overnight.  Hence, no one would want to lend to China, because China would suddenly become insolvent (not that they need to borrow today, but in a Cold War scenario, they's lose the US as their biggest market and no longer have the ability to remain solvent without borrowing most likely).  Their financing our debt is precisely why China will not want to see it come to a Cold War.  And as for a bona fide war, they boast superior numbers, but we still have a more powerful and sophisticated military with no one else even on the horizon to eclipse us.

My answer is that it is only in the unforseeable future.  I don't think there's some timeline after which we'll run out of gas.  Any major problem in the US that would challenge our global hegemony would have to be very isolated, like a natural disaster that crippled a region--say, a massive drought in California, a major disaster in the NY area, an epidemic disease, or most likely, some combination of such events straining our ability to withstand it.  Such things cannot be predicted.","3","3","3","3","3","1","3","2","2","2"

Of course the ones found were useless, but that does not seem to matter to them.","I don't know that conservatives (I'm a moderate by the way) are happy about WMD's existing but I see that you are missing the point.  The fact that these weapons exist in Iraq violate U.N. Security Council Resolution 1441 which required complete disclosure of Iraq's weapons programs and dismantlement of them in a verifiable manner.  It doesn't matter that they were ""useless"", he wasn't supposed to have them and was unwilling to disclose them.  This was the major reason the U.S. went to war in Iraq.

What I think conservatives are happy about is the backlash the liberal left-wing may suffer before this years elections.  All that ""George Bush is a liar"" talk may very well have an effect on voters opinions.  Remember, the declassified documents released alluded to finds all over Iraq so more detail may come out in the coming months as information is declassified.  So its not over yet.

I think it would be a world where slaves still suffered under the lash in every part of the world (it was Christians who led the fight to abolish that).   I think there would be no education except for the rich (It was Christians who invented the idea of free public education, so that children could be taught to read the Bible).  I think we would have little or no science (It was Christians who invented that process, too).  I think our music and art would be greatly impoverished.  I think we would have had a much harsher life today if there had been no Christians to argue that all humans are equal before God and to love Him enough to want to understand the creation He made.

I think the problem is that the voting system is too permissive and allows for multiple votes from the same phone, as well as people using computer dialers to register multiple votes.  This has created problems across every season of the show as ""fan favorites"" are voted for over and over regardless of any true musical ability.

In modern society, liberals favour a liberal democracy with open and fair elections, where all citizens have equal rights by law and an equal opportunity to succeed[2]. Liberalism rejected many foundational assumptions which dominated most earlier theories of government, such as the Divine Right of Kings, hereditary status, and established religion. Fundamental human rights that all liberals support include the right to life, liberty, and property. In many countries, ""modern"" liberalism differs from classical liberalism by asserting that government provision of some minimal level of material well-being takes priority over freedom from taxation. Liberalism has its roots in the Western Enlightenment, but the term now encompasses a diversity of political thought, with adherents spanning a large part of the political spectrum, from left to right. In the context of economics, the term ""liberalism"" refers to economic liberalism, which is associated with the political ideology of liberalism itself.","3","3","3","3","3","2","3","3","3","3"

After two unsuccessful campaigns (1895, 1899) for governor, Vardaman was elected (1903) after a campaign in which he exploited the racial prejudices of poor white farmers toward blacks. As governor (1904–8), he increased taxes on railroads and large corporations and initiated prison reforms. Elected to the U.S. Senate in 1912, he vigorously opposed America's entry into World War I.

Don't rush into ballet but don't be lazy about it either.  You will be surprised at how fast it comes back.  At age 16 and 5'7"" you should not grow much more if at all. Your height is NOT too tall for a ballerina - Balanchine loved tall women for his ballerinas.  I've danced with several women that tall and taller.  If your are dancing with a male partner your IDEAL weight should be no more than 125 lbs and preferably 115 or less, unless your partner is built like a bull - what really matters is techique for lifts.  If you can jump and all your partner has to do is balance you - things will look great and it will be easy.  I've had 135 lb partners that seemed easy to lift like they had springs in their legs and I've danced with 110lb women that were poor jumpers and I literally had to lift off the floor.

I have heard that carbon dating is off because of the waters from the flood. Another good one I have seen is that the devil planted fossils in the Earth to deceive us. These things are humorous, but far from evidence. I will give you that evolution is, in some places, incomplete; but it at least has evidence that strongly supports it. For example: Why is it that a bat's forelimb is far more similar to a human arm than a bird's wing? Their bone structure in their ""arm"" is almost identical to our own. This and countless other bits of evidence support the theory of evolution. But, where is the creationism smoking gun? I will tell you where...it does not exist. 

I know I asked this same question last night, but I wanted to get some more perspective on this.","There was a ""Creation,"" but not in the popular definition of creationism. People that I have spoken with that believe 100% in popular creationism are pretty irrational. There IS NOT any observable evidence to support creationism. It's based on what Christianity is based on, and that's blind faith. People wrote the Bible, and no matter how much devine influence was a part of that, man thinks for himself. The individuals that wrote and eventually edited the Bible undoubtedly put their personal influence in by adding here and omitting there.

Evolution may be incomplete, but that's only because it's difficult to dig up perfect examples and place specimens in the exact/correct order. While the whole picture of evolution will probably never be complete, the pieces are coming together.","2","3","3","3","2","3","2","3","2","3"

Please if you happen to run into him/her . Give him /her my regards","In defense of the asker, believing in love is not the same as believing in god - love is an emotion which is made certain by the experience of it.  Love is an experience, while God is not.  Since love is an experience, you can be certain of its existence (even if it is an illusion or mistaken) when you feel it, while an experience of the presence of god only is proof of the existence of that experience (because it can be illusionary or you can be mistaken about its source) not of God himself.

Yes, in the sense Nietzsche meant, God is dead today.  God has ceased to be a meaningful way to explain the world.  Even most devout christians look to science to explain the natural world today, which is why they try to claim that creationism is science.  Whether or not God actually exists is a different question.  When Nietzsche made this statement he was commenting on the replacing of God with enlightenment values, and there is no doubt that this is what has in fact occurred in the Modern West, even among Christians.","2","2","3","3","3","3","3","3","3","3"

My wife wants to stay in China for the 6 years but it means that I will only see my 3 young children (girl 11, boy 7, girl 5) from my first marriage for 4 weeks a year. This is a very difficult decision to make and I want your feedback.  Please give serious answers.  Thank you.","Think in the long run what will be the best for your children. Girl will be 17, boy 13, and the other girl 11 when you may or may not come home for good. What will your relationship be like for you and your kids. Will they resent you for being away so long or will they be happy you are pursuing a dream job. I would give this some serious thought because those kids, especially the boy will need there dad. Those teenage years are tough. Do what your heart tells you to do. Money is not the most important thing in life. Your kids will only be young once and then they'll be gone and no longer need you at all. If your present wife truly loves you she'll let you make the best decision for you and your kids.","2","1","2","1","2","1","3","3","2","2"

However as the war progressed the stand of the American people changed and they wanted to see Saddam Hussein removed from power and actually did not want the war to end until this was accomplished, which was an amazing change during what had turned out to be a 6 week War.  Americans still wanted Saddam removed throughout the 1990's and early parts of this century.  It has only been since we got involved in this war with Iraq that the public has slowly changed their idea of what we were doing with Iraq.","2","3","2","3","1","3","3","2","3","3"
"text131SC","How can you justify Christianity?","this is something that always bothers me. How do christians still manage to keep thier faith KNOWING their whole religion is stolen? Jesus walked this earth as a great leader, ill admit, but he wasnt claimed as the messiah till CENTURIES after his death. Plus, every single christian holiday was stolen from my religion, paganism. Perfectly. they made the religions coincide so it would be easier to convert people i understand, but jesus was born in spring. why but christmas in december, coinciding with the Pagan Yuletide? christians originally worshipped on saturday, like the jewish, but even that was changed to the pagan day of worship, SUNDAY. nothing in christianity is original, so how do people manage to BELEIVE? Also, i was incredibly surprised when i read the davinci code yesterday, and saw all that i have been saying for YEARS. Finally, a popular book broadcasting the truth. Thanks. and no bible verses please. the bible doesnt probe anything either, it was written by MAN not GOD!!","The Da Vinci code ... great book, wonderful mystery..found in the fiction section. I'm not going to ""justify"" Christianity for you, there's no need. As for Christmas winter or spring, doesn't matter it's the celebration of the birth of the savior. Easter? Not about a bunny but the risen savior, conquering death. Sunday worship? It was the final bondage of the law being discarded. Your day of rest and worship can be any day. If you're turned off by churches, I get that. But, man kind yearns for something to be in awe of and that is our creator. For a really great journey I recommend Donald Miller's ""Blue Like Jazz - nonreligious thoughts on Christian spirituality"" Not preachy, answers a lot of questions.

Many times, the mainstream media run roughshod over the facts (for example, the CBS/Dan Rather/Martha Mapes debacle involving manufactured evidence in the Bush National Guard story).  But, even if ""true facts"" are presented, you need to be aware of how those facts are manipulated and presented.  For example, you will never see a liberal defined as a ""rabid liberal"", no matter how extreme their views, while it is quite common and accepted to call a conservative ""rabid"".

How can there be meaning in something that seeks to penetrate outside of the realm of reason.  Can there be any meaning without reason?","Some would say, an artwork's meaning is what you make of it when you look at it. Others would say it doesn't matter if the viewer finds meaning in an artwork or not, because the meaning is in the artist all along. Of course, as viewer, you are reserved the right to call both this reasoning a lot of bull (if in case you really do find modern art meaningless). That's what's disgustingly wrong about modern art and modern artists--they'd have to brainwash you first with what they believe in before you could start appreciating their work--which, to me, is a lot of bull.

Several elderly men visited here from Germany in 1995 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the end of the war, and spoke of how well they felt they were treated.

"text691AH","Do you consider Jackson Pollack a great artist?","If a 3 year old can produce the same results or it looks like someone puked on a canvas why is it hanging in a museum?","A 3 year old CAN'T paint like Pollock.  If you don't see that, you're not paying very close attention to the work of either.  But practically any adult can be taught to paint realistic, representational images with a high degree of technical polish.  And Bob Ross and all his imitators show how easy it is for anyone with a few paints and brushes to crank out formulaic, decorative pictures.

Bottom line?  Pollock made paintings that exemplify a particular time and place, and like any good experiment, give me a great deal to think about.  If I'm interested in criticism of what Pollock and the other abstract expressionists thought they were doing (and I am) I can find plenty of insightful writing that doesn't resort to vomit similes to make the point.

"text1264PG","If a man commits a crime, but his wife is innocent of that crime, can she still be charged for it?","This question has nothing to do about adultery or tax issues.  Simply, if a spouse commits a crime, can his/her spouse who did not commit the crime be charged for it. If so, (or not) what law supports your answer.","Before a crime can be brought to trial, it has to be brought before a grand jury.  If no one presses charges on the woman in the first place, then of course she won't be brought to trial in the first place.  But if somebody, say, accuses her of being an accomplice, that charge will be brought up in front of a grand jury.  In Amemdment 5 (or 6?) of the US Constitution, all charges must be brought before a grand jury to decide if there is even reason for a trial.  If the person pressing charges against the wife cannot come up with sufficient evidence to accuse her of something, then that charge dies right there.  But if there is some evidence, then she would be brought to trial on the count of being an accomplice.  Then there is the trial.  If the jury believes she is guilty of helping her husband with the crime, she will have some consequence (short period of jail, community service, etc.).  But if there is no evidence at all to support her being an accomplice, then there would be no reason of anyone pressing charges on her.","2","3","1","2","3","3","3","1","3","3"

The city can get pretty packed during the taste of Chicago, so hotels may be hard to find.  AGP is a little more than a mile away from Grant Park, but it's a nice walk with sights like The Disney Store, the Apple Store, the Tribune Building, the Chicago River, and Millenium park along the way.  It will probably be cheaper to stay on te Grant Park side of the river, though you may have problems finding a room now.  Definitely try out the Taste of Chicago because it's the best time to be in the city, but plan on going during the weekdays because the weekends can be packed and pretty overwhelming.

The King James Bible, however, is well out of copyright and therefore is in the public domain.  And many Bible companies allow nearly free use of their works for non-profit uses, such as quotes in church newsletters and so on.  But Bible companies spend a lot of money on their Bibles, and if someone takes their version and puts out a commercial version (such as an audio version) those companies should have the right to license such a use beforehand.","3","3","3","3","2","1","3","3","2","2"

Fairy tales are a way to pass lessons on to children in a way they can understand. One reason that three is a recurring theme is that some of the tales predate modern Christianity to pagan times, and most of those religions saw the number 3 as a sacred number. The Celts saw the holy trinity as Maiden, Mother, Crone. The ancient druids followed the triads which were philosophies based on the idea everything is from above, below, or here. Later the Christians viewed the number three as the Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost.

Three is a sacred number; mother, father,and child; birth, life, and death; morning, noon, and night. It is all around us.","2","1","3","2","3","3","2","2","2","3"

I want the people responsible for 9/11 and I'm waiting and waiting while we waste time in Iraq where there were no mass weapons of destruction only giving opportunity for other country's to build bombs while we are doing nothing in Iraq.

If you wish to come over here and try to make a life for yourself, be prepared to do so legally.  If you want us to treat you as citizens and give you fair rights as a citizen, you need to abide by the law.  If you are going to travel all the way over here illegally just so you can work illegally and try to reap the benefits of our nation without having to give anything back, you need to go home.  We don't have room for everyone within our borders.  If you really want a shot, work for it.

I don't think that my views are ignorant or racist at all.  I think they are fair.  Are people really pro-illegal immigration?  It's not fair to the people born here that people should cross the border illegally and then expect to be given a job, a home, and a place in society.

Just as a few people have mentioned, most hotels, especially the bigger, more expensive ones or the well-known chains will require you to be at least 18 and for some 21. Some of the, shall we say ""seedier"" establishments such as some locally owned motels or places known for high volumes of students coming down for high school senior week events (i.e. Ocean City, Maryland or some places in Florida) will allow some of the younger crowd to check in. I would say that your best best would be to call around and see if there are some understanding hotels/motels managers that will understand your plight, or find a friend or relative that is over the age of 18 or 21 to rent for you and see what the policies are there with that.

What news story from the past year do you feel didn’t get enough attention from the press - and why do you think it didn’t?","I think the Children of Uganda were underreported. Yes, I know Oprah did a special piece on it on her show and all and that was great, but millions of children have died. Children are surrounded by death and its inevitability too early in life. Children are taken as prisoners, forced to watch their friends and families murdered and fight civilians. They are so traumatized that there are instances where they get headaches when they don't see blood. This story really needs to be brought to light again a little more coverage so that maybe we'll be able to pressure the government for a cause worthy of some attention because as many have said, ""This kind of tragedy would not be allowed to happen in America"" and I don't think it should be allowed to happen over in Uganda either. I don't think it's being shown because America hasn't really had to face the kinds of images of the acts happening over there, but these people live them daily.

Mormons believe there are other books not in the ordinary bible.  This is in opposition to all Christianity, but it is particularly sensitive for evangelicals.  Evangelicals cannot give you a reason that the particular books were chosen other than to say they were written by an appropriate group.  That really isn't a reason.  They didn't pick their own books, the Catholic Church picked the New Testament.  They lack an intellectual mechanism to reject any book other than to say ""because we said so.""  They will cite bible passages, but that isn't logically valid, because of course Mormon's could do the same thing with different books.  Evangelicals cannot cite bible passages and simply win the argument.

The bible said we were created by God-self. So why why do you think that evolution means tha humans evolved from apes? We were created directly by God not through the earth. 

And doesn't the fact that microbes, germs, etc keep evolving, proves that evolution did occur?

If not then why are there dinosaur bones?Why didn't Noah take them on the ark too?","There is a big difference between adapting to one's environment and evolving from one species into a completely different class or species. I think the idea that species evolve over millions of years to fit its environment is logically the more ridiculous idea out there. If a species needed to adapt to its environment, it would not take millions of years to do so, because if it could survive those millions of years waiting to evolve, obviously they've already adapted enough to their environment to survive, or they would die. The only logical solution is that adaption to one's environment has to take place quick, within one generation, because if a species can survive long enough to produce the next generation obviously their environment is already hospitable to them.

After I finished my contract I was able to find a good job. But working as an employee was not for me so I decided to take some courses so I could work for myself and now I'm self-employed. I'm living a good life same situation I was way back home. The problem,  immigrants come to a new country, they expect that everything will come smoothly, you need to adjust in any situation, be respectful to their custom and tradition. Every where we live or go there is always hardship

to encounter.","3","1","2","2","3","2","3","2","1","2"
"text751SC","Jesus Saves Answer this one?","You believe hte BIBLE is true, you believe everything I'm guessing. Now, why believe it? Would you believe the book ""Alice In Wonderland?"" It's literature too. Who agrees with me, this is also needed, why do people who don't believe in Jesus need to burn in hell? It makes no sense, I would like someone to tell me with this without using the Bible as a reference.","Its a good question.  Too many people try and support the Bible solely with the Bible as evidence.  The same goes for the Quran.  All that quotes from the book itself support is that the book is coherent.  ""Coherence"" is an essential aspect of any system that hopes to be true but it does not establish that truth.  We have the Bible that claims to be the word of God, we have the Quran that claims to be the word of God (and no I am not going to listen to claims that the ""true"" Bible supports the Quran).  How are we to choose between the claims?  We must look outside the two books for support (much like Newcovenant0's answer that, accept it or not, has a perception of God outside of the Bible).

The poeple who say things like ""Alice in Wonderland doesn't claim....."" spectacularly miss the point.   Sorry to say you've probably got the wrong example.  ""The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster"" (and the Quaran) DO make the same claims and are historically accurate.","2","2","2","2","2","3","2","3","3","3"
"text1696PG","Why did liberals create this polarization in America?","all societies need a culture to hold them together, the culture in America in the 50's was Christianity. then liberals decided to fight against that culture in the name of seperation of church and state and twisted into their own fashion. it meant to have no Christian culture in any public place even though we are founded on the principles of Christianity. OK i see why they wanted that, fine, but then after stripping the culture of america away,  what filled that commonality? nothing as usual liberals are selfish for the moment and don't think long term. there is nothing that binds americans together anymore because liberals took only thing that did and threw it away without replacing it with something else. leftist are more extreme and right wings are more extreme...what happend to respect...why don't liberals respect the culture that created america. why did they strip that away from americans...UNITED WE STATE DIVIDE WE FALL...there is more division in america than unity...","Hmmm... So a question full of lies about America being a 'Christian' country wonders about polarisation. For your imformation the 1st amendment says ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof"" so it looks like those polarising liberals you whine about were people like Jefferson and Madison.

In other words, go and read some history before using YA as a platform for nonsense you just made up - The USA is not a 'Christian' country, it is a country that has a majority who are Christian but also has laws to protect the rest from bigots like you.","2","3","2","3","1","1","2","2","2","1"
"text829AH","Can a coat of arms be created today and be considered legitimate?","Specifically, this question would apply to a situation where a family doesn't have a coat of arms because of a lack of family history or lack of continuity of surname (either through orphaning, creation of new surname, hyphenating of surnames etc). What sorts of guidelines must be followed? I would really appreciate if someone who is an expert (or close to it) in heraldry could answer this question.","Yes, but . . .

Arms and crests are granted by letters patent. The Crown delegates its authority to issue such letters patent to the Kings of Arms. Before they can act in each case they must first have a warrant from the Earl Marshal agreeing to the granting of the arms. The first step in applying for a grant of arms is to submit a petition, or memorial as it is called, to the Earl Marshal. This will be drawn up for the signature of the petitioner by one of the officers of arms if it is felt probable that such a petition will be accepted. There are no fixed criteria of eligibility for a grant of arms, but such things as awards or honours from the Crown, civil or military commissions, university degrees, professional qualifications, public and charitable services, and eminence or good standing in national or local life, are taken into account. When approaching a herald with a view to petitioning for a grant of arms it is desirable to submit a curriculum vitae.","3","2","3","3","3","3","3","1","3","3"
"text1044AH","Book recommendations?","I'm interested in books in the travel/ culture/ autobiography area, focusing on cultural differences and living in certain cultures, especially oriental or african ones. <br/>I've read ""Memoirs of a Geisha"", ""Not without my Daughter"" by Betty Mahmoody, ""Burned Alive"" by Suad and ""The White Masai"" by Corinne Hofmann and I'm currently looking for similar books. <br/>Any ideas?","I know someone recommended the Good Earth but I have to add in my two sense, I hated that book!! Every time one man spoke it started with ""Well and then"". It drove my crazy. However, the idea of the book is good, if you can suffer through the filler and get to the substance.

One cultural book I have read recently that I did enjoy was Like Water for Chocolate. It was written by Laura Esquivel and has hit the bestseller list in both Mexico and the US. It tells the story of a Mexican woman during the time of the Revolution. Her family has a tradition that the youngest daughter should not marry but stay to take care of the current matriarch of the family. Yet, the woman, Tita, falls in love. Her mother refuses to allow her to marry, so her suitor marries her sister instead to stay close by. The book explores the role of women in Mexican society. It includes romance, action, and an odd element of humor with a splash of magical realism. A good read!","3","3","2","3","1","3","2","2","3","2"
"text118AH","Were the Knights Templar really homosexual?","Or was that just part of a smear campaign to destroy the order?

Honoré De Balzac seemed to think they were homosexual.","Homosexual acts or as it was called at the time sodomy was a common accusation leveled by church officials. These accusations were unfounded at best, and did not get anywhere with the inquisitors. As for the Knights Templar being openly homosexual ""no"" they were not. We must remember that the Templars were monks, blessed by the papacy not only with the duty to protect Jerusalem, and its pilgrims but also to be monks. Giving and attending Mass on a regular basis as is common with most members of the cisterian order and living by that rule. (The monk order where the Templars came from hence the white tunic).","3","3","2","3","2","3","2","3","2","3"
"text1177NE","How do you know if you have Road Rage?","I read that they are trying to have it classified as an actual prognosis.  How would you describe your symptoms?","Road rage is nothing more than getting pissed off while driving,  usually by something stupid done by another driver.   We all get it,  but most do not get angry to the extent to act upon it violently. Yesterday I almost got hit on my motorcyle because of a dumb driver not paying attention.   I got mad,  but kept it under control.  Yes,  it was road rage,  because I was angry enough to cause great physical harm to the person,  but instead chose control my anger.

I have found when people get behind the wheel of a car,  many change considerable.  The nicest guy or girl will often forget they are in a 2 ton machine capable of killing people as easy as any gun or knife.   They take unnecessary risks,  and their attitude changes.   They are not the same nice person they normally are.  They turn into walking, talking rectums, contributing to the rage factor.","2","3","3","3","3","3","2","1","3","3"
"text1982PG","Why don't illegals go back to their country, and fight like Americans did for our nation?","I keep hearing how these illegals love their own nation, yet they will not give it Respect.  They come to America and say horrible things about their nations, instead of staying and fixing the problems.<br/>American's stood their ground and created one of the, if not the freest nation in the world.  It's not perfect, by any means, the third world corruption that runs other nations runs rampid through our government.  Americans will make a stand when they have had enough, and it appears that time is at hand.<br/>Let them return home before our laws change, and they have worse problems to deal with than angry Americans.  How about their homeland's rulers, how will they feel when they get not only you back, but a bill and fines for services rendered.  Deportation costs, and fines for any other criminal acrivity that you committed beyond crossing our borders.<br/>America will show it has a back bone against other invading nations.  Illegal Aliens are not immigrants, they are criminals.","That is what I don't get either. There are plenty of other countries poor and starving BUT not invading the US. It is not our problem. Hell they have all the forces of the killer gang MS13 why don't they fight for their country? I am sick of the excuses, they shouldn't be here plain and simple. They broke our laws as soon as the crossed our border illegally and many continue to break the laws after they sneak in. It is a known fact they commit serious crimes and run for the border for a few months and sneak back in under another name. No Americans are hardly perfect but when a crime is committed we sure as don't run away, we wind up in jail or prison. We sure as hell don't get a free ride for breaking the laws.","2","2","2","2","1","2","3","1","1","1"
"text322SC","Poll on Atheist Morality?","For atheists, what factors do you use to determine right from wrong:  1) personal conscience  2) local laws  3) consequences

As you answer, please explain why your choice is reliable, and how you evaluate its reliability (ex. how do you know if your personal conscience is reliable or not?)","Common sense.  I don't feel the need to kill or steal, so why should I.  Local Laws have little to no effect on me.  If I choose to speed, I will speed.  I don't feel I have to most of the time because I want to enjoy what's going on around me so I do.  Consequences are not as big in an atheists book of morality as they are in a Christians for example.  If an atheist breaks the rules, they hold themselves accountable and know they screwed up.  Christians claim they are going to be burned in hell for eternity for doing wrong unless they can atone for it some how.","3","1","2","2","2","2","1","2","2","1"

thats like a sorry excuse for "" i dont know what the hell im talking about""

does anyone agree with me? and i would like to hear what any of you has to say about this topic","i think those who don't really have ""faith"" use that word just as much. ""christians"" are part of a religion, whereas people who actually believe in god can be different. it just takes studying, researching and knowing what you believe. i believe in god, but i don't agree with every christian dogmatic doctrine on the subject of just having faith. there are some things we cannot explain, ever.. so in some cases it does revert back to having faith (which is belief NOT based on material evidence or absolute proof) quite frankly.. faith is the cornerstone, though i agree it is used as a crutch far too often.

From what I remember, we felt that Sadam had WMD's (weapons of mass destruction).  So we went to war.  I really don't understand why we are still there.  It I were President, I would have pulled the military out after we crushed their military and especially after we realised that maybe they don't have WMD's.  At first I was pro-let's get them first.  But now I think that it would be best to bring our people home and leave other countries alone unless they attack us or if we have clear evidence that they are about to attack us.  So the difference before and after is that a lot of Americans were ready for a war and now we aren't.","2","2","3","3","1","2","2","1","2","1"
