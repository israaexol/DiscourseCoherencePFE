They seperated and divorced after 23 years.  My mom decided she didn't want to be married or have kids and left.  My dad tried everything to convince her to stay.  Turning his life and ours upside down to try to please her.  All I can say is think of your kids first.  If your wife wants to leave there is not really anything you can do.  Just let her know you love her and want to work things out.  The rest is up to her.  Just remember your kids are going through this too!

"text241PG","WHY DO people & HOW CAN I  get treated different (better or worse) because they are unique?","beef is this: we all have prejudism against us in one way or another. Some of us receive financial benefits from it which causes more praejudicium. According to some my sex is wrong,my skin color is wrong,I'm not sexy enough,not rich enough,or you name it. Who decides the group that gets $ benefits or more social graces, or more job opportunities? Because of what happened to them or their INDIRECT ancestors? Or because of their physical characteristics? I WANT IN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!","Qualified people never fail. Because when you qualify yourself for doing something perfect - whatever it is,  a carpenter or a doctor or a hairdresser or a farmer, your confidence level will be stable. You will not worry about other factors than the work you are qualified to perform. You will make it big. Abraham Lincoln was not a handsome man - see where he reached. Charlie Chaplin in my opinion is not a handsome man - see where he reached. You have so many millions of them unknown but are happy because they are good at doing what they got themselves trained. Just find out what you can do perfect even if it is cleaning garbage - a good cleaner will be respected for his job. Problem with humans are their inability to perfectly match their ability and expectation or to strike a balance between them.","2","2","1","1","1","2","3","2","3","2"
"text1059SC","why were adam and eve punished for eating the forbidden fruit if they didnt know what they were doing was wong","if there was no sin at that time how were theypunished and why?","They did know, they were told they could eat anything but the fruit from the tree of knowledge, and they were persuaded even though they knew what they had been told (just like a child who is told don't do that, but the child tries anyway at least once until he or she is punished - the punishment comes regardless if they know why, as they disobeyed).  What they did NOT know was that they were naked, but that came to them after the fruit of knowledge was eaten - which then made them afraid and they began their own punishment as well as the one their maker gave to them when he tossed them out of the garden and put a guard around the tree.  The snake gets a bad rap now because the one who talked the woman into it took on the form of a serpent - who btw had legs until he was punished for his part in the situation by having them taken away and then being told man would always despise him for what he had done.","2","2","2","2","2","3","3","3","2","3"

With all the work and bravery that has happen through the years in the Harry Pottor world, how can this be? What about the profecy? ""Neither can live while the other survives""?

I read that she may be interested in killing Harry off in order to prevent publication of less than worthy books years from now when she is no longer writing them...and she has had the last chapter of book seven written for years....before all the madness and success.  I care about what happens in the books...and of course I don't think anyone wants to see Harry die...and I dont think she would let Voldemort survive and not Harry, because that would just be letting evil win.

As soon as you get off the ship, there will be TONS of Volkswagen taxi cabs waiting for people to jump in.  We actually were able to hire one for 40.00 US the entire day, I believe like 6-8 hours we were there.  We negotiated this before we even got in the cab.  He took us on a tour of Mazatlan, shopping, to eat.  Anywhere we wanted to go.  He told us some history of the town.  He was really really  nice and spoke very good English.  If you can't speak Spanish.  Anyway, just a suggestion.

When I flew to New Orleans in 2004, I was told that you can't take pictures of federal buildings.  Furthermore, when I was in Baltimore, a travel guide informed me that I couldn't take any pictures in the airport there.  So can I take pictures of the Lincoln Memorial, Washington Monument, WWII Memorial or the White House?  I don't know for sure if I am going to D.C. next month, but if I have the chance to go, I want to make sure that I know where and where not I am allowed to take pictures.  Thank you in advance for your response.","When we were there we took over 200 pictures in 5 days. You can only get so close to the White House. We didn't get the tour but it is fenced and guarded quite well. Anything outside that fence is up to you. Some places we were not allowed to photograph were inside the Capital on the House floor (they actually take everyones camera away there), in the National Archives where there is a tattered flag on display, and the Declaration of Indepedence and the Constitution.  These last two could be photographed but with no flash.  They recommend you step out into the hallway and test fire your camera to make sure it is not going to flash as you only get one mistake and you are escorted out.  All the other monuments and such were fine.","2","3","3","3","2","3","3","3","2","3"

My other cousin had his bracelet taken by people who wore descent clothes! Everywhere in the world, there will be pickpocketeers, carnappers etc. Just be careful! Dont be showy.

Chances are, they're mostly concerned about your safety.  After you've found out their concerns, make every effort to allay their fears.  If you really want to go, tell them you'll call a couple times a day.  Let them know where you'll be, when you'll be there.  Tell them how it makes you feel that they won't let you go, but don't be accusatory.  Let them know you think their concerns are justified and that you understand.  Tell them they've done a great job rearing you, and that you appreciate the trust they've already placed in you.  The most important thing is not to *convince* them, but to get them to WANT to let you go.  If you try to convince them, you'll almost certainly fail.  To learn a great many things about getting what you want (and getting others to WANT to give those things to you), read the book referenced below.  Good luck!

What are some reasons why we could clash behaviors?","ok, I know the previous answer was meant to help you but in my experience yahoo horoscopes are a bunch of crap, many horoscopes on line tell you that you are compatible with anybody. April 20 would make him an aries/ taurus he is on the cusp which may work in your in advantage of your relationship. Taurus is known for being stubborn and bull headed and a libra can use artistic ways of working around this or it may ignite into a very abusive relationship because alot of libras have a temper like non other in the zodiac and most tauruses don't know how to respond to this without fighting. The aries side of him is spoiled and wants everything his way. In order to keep the libra balance you will naturally try to compensate. Some libras can do this beautifully while others can only tolerate it for so long. An aries is an infant when it comes to love and many times the libra will feel more like a mother or care provider than a significant other.","1","1","2","1","1","1","2","2","3","1"

I've always wondered why. I'm not sure if it has something to do with the British Empire or colonialism. Its just a question I had in mind. 

Anyone else noticed?","Probably because, their country is so filthy rich, they support them financially in every way, better, then Americans, can. It was the English, who discovered America!

Anyone know if that's true?","well... think of it this way... if you ever get in trouble, they will investigate you.. they will pull all of your credit records, bank statements, library records, school grades, medical records.. anything that you've done in your lifetime is in a record somewhere... there is nothing that you do that goes unnoticed... remember that.

Of course you become more knowledgable and experienced the older you get.  But if you have not been living the past fourty years of your life, what have you been doing? Children's memories and consciousness are not fully developed til they are five, and they will not use metacognition (thinking about thinking, or about what you know or don't know, about WHY you do certain things..) until age 11.  They often are exposed to more elements in high school and here they become more intelligent and open-minded.  Of course it does depend on the individual.","3","3","2","3","2","2","2","1","3","2"

1.  What do you think about the 2010 being held in South Africa?<br/>2.  Do you think our crime rate will go up?","1. I am extremely happy to see the first world cup on the African continent to be held in South Africa. I feel that it will work towards further integration and give everyone one more chance to show the world what South Africa is capable of achieving.

2. I do not think that the crime rate will go up in South Africa. It levelled off a few years ago and violent crimes are actually dropping. As the levels of wealth and education are rising, crime will, in my opinion, go down. I see no reason why the world cup would change that trend.","3","2","3","3","3","1","3","3","3","3"
"text1273SC","When is Hallowe'en night celebrated, and what is it's origin?","Is it true that it is also known as Amateur's Night?","Halloween began as Samhain, the celtic new year (end of summer, start of winter) when our world and the spirit world came very close and spirits were able to pass into our world (costumed trick-or-treaters). The spirits would mess with people's houses, so to appease the spirits, people would put food offerings out (trick-or-treat candy).  Also, they would try to scare the spirits away with frightening faces carved into gourds (jack-o-lanterns).

When the Catholic Church came along, they altered the native pagan festival of Samhain into All Hallow's Eve (the Church did this with many pagan rituals--May Day and the May Pole, Easter--which comes from ancient love goddess Ashtaroth, whose symbols were the rabbit and the egg).  The reason the Church altered the pagan festivals to fit Christianity was to convert the pagans; they figured the best way to do so was to make it seem like the pagan's lives weren't really changing...just some of the names.","3","3","3","3","3","3","2","3","3","3"

"text1143AH","I am hoping to get some of my first edition books signed by the authors.  Any recommendations on how to do it?","If they have no individual website and no longer need to do book signings.... what next?  I am specifically trying for Gabriel Garcia Marquez, John Irving, Joseph Heller, Wally Lamb, ...","For such successful, well-known writers, having your first editions signed will not be as simple as just sending it to them. Authors can be notoriously recluse, and sending a valuable first edition to their publisher or agent sounds a bit risky to me. In the book ""A Gentle Madness: Bibliophiles, Bibliomanes, and the Eternal Passion for Books"" by Nicholas A. Basbanes the author recalls meeting Joseph Heller and, while signing his book, Heller noted the value of the book and commented that he didn't even have a first edition of ""Catch-22"". Basbanes' book is very informative regarding book collecting, and I'd reccomend it to someone in your position.

Also, while writers of this caliber my not hold signings in bookstores, you should research literary festivals, like the New Yorker Festival. Maybe your writer is speaking on a panel discussion there. My advice would be to go and act like a groupie trying to get backstage at a rock concert. This tactic may or may not work, depending on your force of personality and the approachability of the author, but I'd give it a try.","3","3","3","3","3","2","3","3","3","3"

Hopefully, he will return soon safe and sound. However, your husband became a soldier because he wanted to actively protect his family and defend the principles he apparently holds very dearly. If your husband does not do his duty, he will feel like less of a man, like he has failed as a husband and provider. Your husband, and the many others currently serving, are continuing a proud legacy, which allows the US to remain the greatest country on earth. Unfortunately, it requires a great deal of sacrifice, which the family left behind bears the greatest brunt of. If it is any consolation, there is a lot of talk on various blogs regarding accelerated drawdown of US forces in Iraq by the end of calendar year 2006. If the new govt holds, violence should begin to abate soon.

I was crushed, like you, for the longest time I never thought that the pain would ever cease. When your ex calls you, it feels like a slap in the face and pain really starts to hurt, to me that is a crappy thing to do to someone, also bragging about how their life is going great. My advice to you, is that when you put your trust in we humans, more or less except for a few good people out there, they will let you down. Let me tell you how I got over it, I asked God for help. If you believe in God or not, that is your choice, but I can tell you personally, He will never let you down, and that He loves you aboundingly, like a cup under a waterfall, it keeps on overflowing.

First make a character in your head; find their personality, likes and dislikes, special relationships, etc. Then build off of that; what's so special about that person? Why are they in your story? After that, dramatise (sp?) and write your fool head off. Don't ever ask for ideas; to be truely passionate and put full emotion in your writing (which can only make it better) you need to do it yourself that way, you can say, 'Yeah. This is all mine.'

We had a child right away and then one day after 4 years of marriage when I woke up he was looking at me, packed suitcase by the bed, and said ""I don't think we love each other any more"".  Then he left me with our son and moved in with a girl from his work.  He hardly ever wanted to see our son and frankly, after 29 years I am glad he was gone and never came back.

Why are they so adamant on changing America?","Because the REPulsicans in power, as well as most Neo-Cons subscribe to the teachings of Leo Strauss, a German political philosopher. Strauss teaches that deception is the norm in political life, and that societies should be hierarchical - divided between an elite, who should and must lead, and the masses that must follow.  He also taught that religion is paramount for the masses alone, and that the elite not be bound by it.

In order to control the masses, their rights must be curtailed and controlled.  Privacy, and the free exchange of ideas, must be controlled.  Freedom and Liberty run counter to keeping the attention of the masses on their own immediate surroundings rather than on the political maneuverings that happen every day to shape their lives, and thus, their own private prisons.","1","3","2","2","1","3","1","2","1","1"

The half-starved former POWs were then armed and put back on the front lines. When the war was over those same former POWs were sent to the gulag for the sin of being taken alive in the first place!

After Stalin would give a speech he would always get a standing ovation. However the secret police would take note of whoever would stop clapping first and then send them to gulag. When people realized that was the policy, they would remain standing and clapping for hours and hours even after Stalin had left for his next appointment.

Then, they rolled the stones overland on smoothed logs.  No one knows for sure that this is the right theory, and there are plenty of other theories, including, but not limited to aliens, higher powers, and creatures from other dimensions.

As for the age of the pyramids, I believe that most Egyptian pyramids are between 3500 and 3000 years old.  Mayan pyramids seem to be slightly younger, possibly in the 2500 to 1500-year-old range.","3","2","3","3","3","3","2","2","3","3"

anyways, what you should do is write a rough draft of your story, ask your mom or dad or somebody to read your story so far, ask them if they like it and if you should make any changes. then type it up, and go see any publisher. if they like your story, and they think it will sell, they might publish your story for you, and depending on if you are going to write a series or not, if your first book sells big-time, then you can start writing more and more and you will get a higher share of the profit.

Hopefully the girl you like isn't shy, so try to make eye contact with her. This is often the single most important factor in knowing if you have half a decent chance with asking a woman out. If she does look back at you, try to maintain a few seconds of eye contact before casually gazing away and then approaching her. When you finally do approach her, be friendly and smile. Of course, say hi and introduce yourself. Discuss things that you both can relate to. Ask her questions about herself to show your interest in her and try to lead the conversation but let her do most of the talking. If you can get a woman to feel comfortable with talking to you, your chances of asking her to get some coffee later will likely increase. The rest is up to you. The more often you approach women, the better you will get. Practice makes perfect. Good luck.","3","2","2","3","2","3","3","2","3","3"

Philosophers that do try to live their life according to a philosophy are psychotics - much the same as religious people living their life based on a book, or psychiatrists living their lives and lives of others based on their limited theories. Because, let's face it, life is bigger than any book can comprehend - and that's a good thing, or we'd be dull and complacent.

The are developing nuclear weapons so they have some defense from invasion. I think it unlikely that the US would use nuclear weapons as so much of the World economy depends on Iranian oil.

Capital punsihment is what the perpetrator of horrible crimes needs to find justice in his life. If you meet a few people who are twisted beyond all recognition, you begin to understand why there is a death penalty. Not everyone is going to be rehabilitated. Moral clarity is a heloful thing. You do a terrible criminal act, you know for certain you are going to get the char - or lethal injection. All of the arguments against the death penalty presume that the guy who brutally knifed all of those people was sort of having a bad day and no one had ever really loved him. Maybe that is true, but loving the guy isn't going to stop him from killing more. A few people have even figured out that death - as th punishment for their crime - is the best thing they can do to pay for the horrible wrongs they did. In facing up to justice, a few are able to find redemption.

We actually were able to hire one for 40.00 US the entire day, I believe like 6-8 hours we were there.  We negotiated this before we even got in the cab.  He took us on a tour of Mazatlan, shopping, to eat.  Anywhere we wanted to go.  He told us some history of the town.  He was really really  nice and spoke very good English.  If you can't speak Spanish.  Anyway, just a suggestion.  For 40 bucks the entire day and being able to go wherever and have a driver at your disposal, it was well worth it.","3","2","3","3","2","2","3","2","1","2"

When I flew to New Orleans in 2004, I was told that you can't take pictures of federal buildings.  Furthermore, when I was in Baltimore, a travel guide informed me that I couldn't take any pictures in the airport there.  So can I take pictures of the Lincoln Memorial, Washington Monument, WWII Memorial or the White House?  I don't know for sure if I am going to D.C. next month, but if I have the chance to go, I want to make sure that I know where and where not I am allowed to take pictures.  Thank you in advance for your response.","When we were there we took over 200 pictures in 5 days. You can only get so close to the White House. We didn't get the tour but it is fenced and guarded quite well. Anything outside that fence is up to you. Some places we were not allowed to photograph were inside the Capital on the House floor (they actually take everyones camera away there), in the National Archives where there is a tattered flag on display, and the Declaration of Indepedence and the Constitution.  These last two could be photographed but with no flash.  They recommend you step out into the hallway and test fire your camera to make sure it is not going to flash as you only get one mistake and you are escorted out.  All the other monuments and such were fine.","2","3","3","3","2","3","3","3","2","3"

What's your take??","I had graduated from the University of Santo Tomas which is located in Manila, Philippines. I used to be wearing necklace, bracelets & earrings. However, when I learned about how notorious some people are, I didnt wear one until I graduated & I was safe. I had 2 cousins who also studied in UST who had lost their jewelry, usually snatched from them. She even run after the child who took it, but it had already been passed to somebody. My other cousin had his bracelet taken by people who wore descent clothes! Everywhere in the world, there will be pickpocketeers, carnappers etc. Just be careful! Dont be showy.

Chances are, they're mostly concerned about your safety.  After you've found out their concerns, make every effort to allay their fears.  If you really want to go, tell them you'll call a couple times a day.  Let them know where you'll be, when you'll be there.  Tell them how it makes you feel that they won't let you go, but don't be accusatory.  Let them know you think their concerns are justified and that you understand.  Tell them they've done a great job rearing you, and that you appreciate the trust they've already placed in you.  The most important thing is not to *convince* them, but to get them to WANT to let you go.  If you try to convince them, you'll almost certainly fail.  To learn a great many things about getting what you want (and getting others to WANT to give those things to you), read the book referenced below.  Good luck!

The aries side of him is spoiled and wants everything his way. In order to keep the libra balance you will naturally try to compensate. Some libras can do this beautifully while others can only tolerate it for so long.

Of course you become more knowledgable and experienced the older you get.  But if you have not been living the past fourty years of your life, what have you been doing? Children's memories and consciousness are not fully developed til they are five, and they will not use metacognition (thinking about thinking, or about what you know or don't know, about WHY you do certain things..) until age 11.

I am extremely happy to see the first world cup on the African continent to be held in South Africa.

2. I do not think that the crime rate will go up in South Africa. It levelled off a few years ago and violent crimes are actually dropping.

"text1273SC","When is Hallowe'en night celebrated, and what is it's origin?","Is it true that it is also known as Amateur's Night?","Halloween began as Samhain, the celtic new year (end of summer, start of winter) when our world and the spirit world came very close and spirits were able to pass into our world (costumed trick-or-treaters). The spirits would mess with people's houses, so to appease the spirits, people would put food offerings out (trick-or-treat candy).  Also, they would try to scare the spirits away with frightening faces carved into gourds (jack-o-lanterns).

When the Catholic Church came along, they altered the native pagan festival of Samhain into All Hallow's Eve (the Church did this with many pagan rituals--May Day and the May Pole, Easter--which comes from ancient love goddess Ashtaroth, whose symbols were the rabbit and the egg).  The reason the Church altered the pagan festivals to fit Christianity was to convert the pagans; they figured the best way to do so was to make it seem like the pagan's lives weren't really changing...just some of the names.","3","3","3","3","3","3","2","3","3","3"

I am specifically trying for Gabriel Garcia Marquez, John Irving, Joseph Heller, Wally Lamb, ...","For such successful, well-known writers, having your first editions signed will not be as simple as just sending it to them. Authors can be notoriously recluse, and sending a valuable first edition to their publisher or agent sounds a bit risky to me. In the book ""A Gentle Madness: Bibliophiles, Bibliomanes, and the Eternal Passion for Books"" by Nicholas A. Basbanes the author recalls meeting Joseph Heller and, while signing his book, Heller noted the value of the book and commented that he didn't even have a first edition of ""Catch-22"". Basbanes' book is very informative regarding book collecting, and I'd reccomend it to someone in your position.

Also, while writers of this caliber my not hold signings in bookstores, you should research literary festivals, like the New Yorker Festival. Maybe your writer is speaking on a panel discussion there. My advice would be to go and act like a groupie trying to get backstage at a rock concert. This tactic may or may not work, depending on your force of personality and the approachability of the author, but I'd give it a try.","3","3","3","3","3","2","3","3","3","3"

Hopefully, he will return soon safe and sound. However, your husband became a soldier because he wanted to actively protect his family and defend the principles he apparently holds very dearly. If your husband does not do his duty, he will feel like less of a man, like he has failed as a husband and provider. Your husband, and the many others currently serving, are continuing a proud legacy, which allows the US to remain the greatest country on earth.

He also taught that religion is paramount for the masses alone, and that the elite not be bound by it.

In order to control the masses, their rights must be curtailed and controlled.  Privacy, and the free exchange of ideas, must be controlled.

"text826AH","How was Stalin worse than Hitler?","A lot of information would be great.","Here are some examples.  When the Red Army was moving west, Russian POWs were freed from German camps. The half-starved former POWs were then armed and put back on the front lines. When the war was over those same former POWs were sent to the gulag for the sin of being taken alive in the first place!

After Stalin would give a speech he would always get a standing ovation. However the secret police would take note of whoever would stop clapping first and then send them to gulag. When people realized that was the policy, they would remain standing and clapping for hours and hours even after Stalin had left for his next appointment. Whoever dropped from exhaustion first then got sent to the gulag.","2","2","3","3","1","2","3","3","1","2"

Of course the devil is in the details.  I can't recommend the King James Bible except as a common starting point for searching for the truth.  I use it because more believers around the world use the King James in its various forms (King James 1611, King James 1885, King James II, New King James) than any other translation.  Unfortunately there is no Perfect translation (to the best of my knowledge).  So in the meantime I will use the King James and another modern translation (such as the NASB).  And for difficult scriptures I will get down to the original languages.","2","2","2","2","3","1","3","1","2","2"

Then, they rolled the stones overland on smoothed logs.  No one knows for sure that this is the right theory, and there are plenty of other theories, including, but not limited to aliens, higher powers, and creatures from other dimensions.

As for the age of the pyramids, I believe that most Egyptian pyramids are between 3500 and 3000 years old.  Mayan pyramids seem to be slightly younger, possibly in the 2500 to 1500-year-old range.","3","2","3","3","3","3","2","2","3","3"

anyways, what you should do is write a rough draft of your story, ask your mom or dad or somebody to read your story so far, ask them if they like it and if you should make any changes. then type it up, and go see any publisher. if they like your story, and they think it will sell, they might publish your story for you, and depending on if you are going to write a series or not, if your first book sells big-time, then you can start writing more and more and you will get a higher share of the profit.

Hopefully the girl you like isn't shy, so try to make eye contact with her. This is often the single most important factor in knowing if you have half a decent chance with asking a woman out. If she does look back at you, try to maintain a few seconds of eye contact before casually gazing away and then approaching her. When you finally do approach her, be friendly and smile. Of course, say hi and introduce yourself. Discuss things that you both can relate to. Ask her questions about herself to show your interest in her and try to lead the conversation but let her do most of the talking. If you can get a woman to feel comfortable with talking to you, your chances of asking her to get some coffee later will likely increase. The rest is up to you. The more often you approach women, the better you will get. Practice makes perfect. Good luck.","3","2","2","3","2","3","3","2","3","3"

Philosophers that do try to live their life according to a philosophy are psychotics - much the same as religious people living their life based on a book, or psychiatrists living their lives and lives of others based on their limited theories. Because, let's face it, life is bigger than any book can comprehend - and that's a good thing, or we'd be dull and complacent. I do think philosophers are more aware of this than anyone else, so they will be able to resolve their ""fork-ups"" well enough - being able to see it all in perspective.","1","3","3","3","2","2","2","3","3","3"

The are developing nuclear weapons so they have some defense from invasion. I think it unlikely that the US would use nuclear weapons as so much of the World economy depends on Iranian oil. If they withdrew supply of it it would cause widespread economic collapse. Also if Iran did use nuclear weapons Israel would retaliate with overkill. Israel has over 200 nuclear bombs and a very efficient proactive intelligence service that operates well in Muslim countries.

Capital punsihment is what the perpetrator of horrible crimes needs to find justice in his life. If you meet a few people who are twisted beyond all recognition, you begin to understand why there is a death penalty. Not everyone is going to be rehabilitated. Moral clarity is a heloful thing. You do a terrible criminal act, you know for certain you are going to get the char - or lethal injection. All of the arguments against the death penalty presume that the guy who brutally knifed all of those people was sort of having a bad day and no one had ever really loved him. Maybe that is true, but loving the guy isn't going to stop him from killing more. A few people have even figured out that death - as th punishment for their crime - is the best thing they can do to pay for the horrible wrongs they did. In facing up to justice, a few are able to find redemption.

I know the anit-death penalty crowd has a zillion wondeful sounding arguments and that they think they are on the moral highground. Truth is that they misapprehend the true nature of mankind ... they are in total denial about the bad stuff these guys on death row did and would do again..

And on top of that the officails worry about using a dirty needle when the time actually comes... Their gonna be dead in a few minutes anyway so what would it matter?

Take them out into a field and kill them however they killed their victim.. In the case of multiple murders they should either pick the most violent one or choose a combination of elements from all and kill them that way instead of that sterile room with the sterile tubes and the sterile needle... or just tie them to a post out in the wilderness with a few superficial cuts on them and let the insects and animals have their way.","2","2","3","3","1","1","3","1","1","1"

Serious answers please, my thesis depends on it. ^!^","I think Confucianism is come down to us in the forms, mainly, of the collected sayings of him, as well as the philosophical writings and views on government.  You, know, I never really got into confucianism when I studied it in college in religious studies, but I remember I could find no fault in it.  It is barely discussed, it seems, but has the potential to transform the evil which exists in our world.  Confucius had the idea that there was a fundamental ""good"" within all people and that government must appeal to the good and thus transform the people into ones who would feel the shame before committing an evil act, thus feeling the punishment prior to the misdeed.  Confucius had a much higher opinion of basic human nature than most Western theologians, it seems.  I would offer this:  Let confucianism transform China first, something it has failed to do, though it is often held up as the pinnacle of all Chinese historical thought and culture.  Let it do that first, then the West will talk seriously with this movement.","3","2","1","2","2","2","2","3","3","3"

"text1862SC","Should people have to work on Sundays? Why or why not?","I think that workers should not work on Sundays and the only places that should be open are places of worship, hospitals, and pharmacies. Places like grocery stores, gasoline stations, and restaurants should no be opened on Sundays so that workers can spend time with family & friends and so that they can also spend time and worship.","Religiously speaking I concur 100%.  The Bible states that our families, our slaves, and we should not work on the Sabbath day.  Now, slavery is not slavery as it was back then ... rather it is the common worker who gets paid wages.  Owners of stores who choose to remain open are sinning, and pressuring their workers to sin too.  The blame also gets spread to we, the consumers ... if we engage a business on the Sabbath day, are we not increasing the owners desire to remain open ---increasing the workers to work???  I try hard not to shop on Sunday, but it's so commonplace that I find myself doing this wrong.

Non-religiously, I believe that workers and owners need down time ... if we do not find time to silence our environment, and minds then we'll all go insane…we may already be there though.","2","3","3","3","2","1","1","1","1","1"

Do you currently have an RV?  If you do it is a great way to go!  If you don't, do you want one?  It is generally pretty expensive to purchase one.  If you don't have one and don't plan to do much ""camping""  I would suggest renting a small trailer from U-haul, get a carrying case for the cat & stay at reputable motels.  I have been a ""full-time"" RVer for 27 years and I love it, so do my 3 cats.  But if it is going to be a one shot type of thing there are much less expensive ways to go.  It is not much more expensive to stay in a motel than it is to stay in an RV park.  Plus if you are not accustomed to driving a truck or school bus they can be difficult to handle at first.  A U-haul towed behind your car would be much easier.","2","2","3","3","3","2","2","3","1","2"

When you go through these emotions for long periods of time with someone you are compatible with(whether a friend, partner, or relative) you assume love because everyone around you proclaims love and most people throw around the term ""I love you"" because it either makes them feel better or they believe it makes you feel better.

Think of bloated egos... This is the time that most Filipinos become hypocrites.

On the other hand, others become simply dumb without them knowing it like in the case of Manny Pacquiao's singing prowess, or lack of it.  Though his voice seems to be a can of sardines being torn apart as you have said, they tend to be very amused and mesmerized by his 'ability'.  The reason for that is simple.

Also, Jews had some knowledge of medecine from all the time they spent in the Middle East where people were pretty advanced in that stuff.

The downside in the crash of the bond market here is that we would no longer be able to borrow to cover our debt; but then, neither would they, since so much of the value of their national wealth is based in holding US bonds that would become worthless overnight.  Hence, no one would want to lend to China, because China would suddenly become insolvent (not that they need to borrow today, but in a Cold War scenario, they's lose the US as their biggest market and no longer have the ability to remain solvent without borrowing most likely).  Their financing our debt is precisely why China will not want to see it come to a Cold War.  And as for a bona fide war, they boast superior numbers, but we still have a more powerful and sophisticated military with no one else even on the horizon to eclipse us.

My answer is that it is only in the unforseeable future.  I don't think there's some timeline after which we'll run out of gas.  Any major problem in the US that would challenge our global hegemony would have to be very isolated, like a natural disaster that crippled a region--say, a massive drought in California, a major disaster in the NY area, an epidemic disease, or most likely, some combination of such events straining our ability to withstand it.  Such things cannot be predicted.","3","3","3","3","3","1","3","2","2","2"
"text1977PG","How sick is it that conservatives are so happy that WMD's were found?","How can anybody be happy that WMD's even exist?  Of course the ones found were useless, but that does not seem to matter to them.","I don't know that conservatives (I'm a moderate by the way) are happy about WMD's existing but I see that you are missing the point.  The fact that these weapons exist in Iraq violate U.N. Security Council Resolution 1441 which required complete disclosure of Iraq's weapons programs and dismantlement of them in a verifiable manner.  It doesn't matter that they were ""useless"", he wasn't supposed to have them and was unwilling to disclose them.  This was the major reason the U.S. went to war in Iraq.

What I think conservatives are happy about is the backlash the liberal left-wing may suffer before this years elections.  All that ""George Bush is a liar"" talk may very well have an effect on voters opinions.  Remember, the declassified documents released alluded to finds all over Iraq so more detail may come out in the coming months as information is declassified.  So its not over yet.

I think there would be no education except for the rich (It was Christians who invented the idea of free public education, so that children could be taught to read the Bible).  I think we would have little or no science (It was Christians who invented that process, too).  I think our music and art would be greatly impoverished.  I think we would have had a much harsher life today if there had been no Christians to argue that all humans are equal before God and to love Him enough to want to understand the creation He made.

Conversely he had been taught that cr*p was bad and sh*t was OK, and I had been taught that sh*t was bad and cr*p OK. The funny thing about all this is that while we all curse, we teach our children not to curse. Of course. Cursing is something we all do but it is something we prefer to leave in the closet. That pretty much is a universal feeling. However, I have a friend who goes to church and all that, but every other world out of his mouth is f**k or some form of the word. He can't help it.

He needs to know that friends don't date friend's exes, especially if you value your friendship with Kristina.

In modern society, liberals favour a liberal democracy with open and fair elections, where all citizens have equal rights by law and an equal opportunity to succeed[2]. Liberalism rejected many foundational assumptions which dominated most earlier theories of government, such as the Divine Right of Kings, hereditary status, and established religion. Fundamental human rights that all liberals support include the right to life, liberty, and property. In many countries, ""modern"" liberalism differs from classical liberalism by asserting that government provision of some minimal level of material well-being takes priority over freedom from taxation. Liberalism has its roots in the Western Enlightenment, but the term now encompasses a diversity of political thought, with adherents spanning a large part of the political spectrum, from left to right. In the context of economics, the term ""liberalism"" refers to economic liberalism, which is associated with the political ideology of liberalism itself.","3","3","3","3","3","2","3","3","3","3"

Admitted to the Mississippi bar in 1881, he practiced law and was a newspaper editor before entering politics. He served (1890–96) in the Mississippi state assembly and was (1894) its speaker. After two unsuccessful campaigns (1895, 1899) for governor, Vardaman was elected (1903) after a campaign in which he exploited the racial prejudices of poor white farmers toward blacks. As governor (1904–8), he increased taxes on railroads and large corporations and initiated prison reforms. Elected to the U.S. Senate in 1912, he vigorously opposed America's entry into World War I.

Don't rush into ballet but don't be lazy about it either.  You will be surprised at how fast it comes back.  At age 16 and 5'7"" you should not grow much more if at all. Your height is NOT too tall for a ballerina - Balanchine loved tall women for his ballerinas.  I've danced with several women that tall and taller.  If your are dancing with a male partner your IDEAL weight should be no more than 125 lbs and preferably 115 or less, unless your partner is built like a bull - what really matters is techique for lifts.  If you can jump and all your partner has to do is balance you - things will look great and it will be easy.  I've had 135 lb partners that seemed easy to lift like they had springs in their legs and I've danced with 110lb women that were poor jumpers and I literally had to lift off the floor.

I have heard that carbon dating is off because of the waters from the flood. Another good one I have seen is that the devil planted fossils in the Earth to deceive us. These things are humorous, but far from evidence. I will give you that evolution is, in some places, incomplete; but it at least has evidence that strongly supports it. For example: Why is it that a bat's forelimb is far more similar to a human arm than a bird's wing? Their bone structure in their ""arm"" is almost identical to our own. This and countless other bits of evidence support the theory of evolution. But, where is the creationism smoking gun? I will tell you where...it does not exist. 

I know I asked this same question last night, but I wanted to get some more perspective on this.","There was a ""Creation,"" but not in the popular definition of creationism. People that I have spoken with that believe 100% in popular creationism are pretty irrational. There IS NOT any observable evidence to support creationism. It's based on what Christianity is based on, and that's blind faith. People wrote the Bible, and no matter how much devine influence was a part of that, man thinks for himself. The individuals that wrote and eventually edited the Bible undoubtedly put their personal influence in by adding here and omitting there.

Evolution may be incomplete, but that's only because it's difficult to dig up perfect examples and place specimens in the exact/correct order. While the whole picture of evolution will probably never be complete, the pieces are coming together.","2","3","3","3","2","3","2","3","2","3"

Please if you happen to run into him/her . Give him /her my regards","In defense of the asker, believing in love is not the same as believing in god - love is an emotion which is made certain by the experience of it.  Love is an experience, while God is not.  Since love is an experience, you can be certain of its existence (even if it is an illusion or mistaken) when you feel it, while an experience of the presence of god only is proof of the existence of that experience (because it can be illusionary or you can be mistaken about its source) not of God himself.

Yes, in the sense Nietzsche meant, God is dead today.  God has ceased to be a meaningful way to explain the world.  Even most devout christians look to science to explain the natural world today, which is why they try to claim that creationism is science.  Whether or not God actually exists is a different question.  When Nietzsche made this statement he was commenting on the replacing of God with enlightenment values, and there is no doubt that this is what has in fact occurred in the Modern West, even among Christians.","2","2","3","3","3","3","3","3","3","3"

"text691AH","Do you consider Jackson Pollack a great artist?","If a 3 year old can produce the same results or it looks like someone puked on a canvas why is it hanging in a museum?","A 3 year old CAN'T paint like Pollock.  If you don't see that, you're not paying very close attention to the work of either.  But practically any adult can be taught to paint realistic, representational images with a high degree of technical polish.  And Bob Ross and all his imitators show how easy it is for anyone with a few paints and brushes to crank out formulaic, decorative pictures.

Bottom line?  Pollock made paintings that exemplify a particular time and place, and like any good experiment, give me a great deal to think about.  If I'm interested in criticism of what Pollock and the other abstract expressionists thought they were doing (and I am) I can find plenty of insightful writing that doesn't resort to vomit similes to make the point.  Meaningless or trivial judgments such as ""what is a great artist?"" or ""what is art?"" are just a waste of time.","2","3","3","3","1","2","2","2","3","2"

"text1264PG","If a man commits a crime, but his wife is innocent of that crime, can she still be charged for it?","This question has nothing to do about adultery or tax issues.  Simply, if a spouse commits a crime, can his/her spouse who did not commit the crime be charged for it. If so, (or not) what law supports your answer.","Before a crime can be brought to trial, it has to be brought before a grand jury.  If no one presses charges on the woman in the first place, then of course she won't be brought to trial in the first place.  But if somebody, say, accuses her of being an accomplice, that charge will be brought up in front of a grand jury.  In Amemdment 5 (or 6?) of the US Constitution, all charges must be brought before a grand jury to decide if there is even reason for a trial.  If the person pressing charges against the wife cannot come up with sufficient evidence to accuse her of something, then that charge dies right there.  But if there is some evidence, then she would be brought to trial on the count of being an accomplice.  Then there is the trial.  If the jury believes she is guilty of helping her husband with the crime, she will have some consequence (short period of jail, community service, etc.).  But if there is no evidence at all to support her being an accomplice, then there would be no reason of anyone pressing charges on her.","2","3","1","2","3","3","3","1","3","3"

We are planning on being there during Taste of Chicaco so any suggestions for this.","First of all, make your reservations now!  The city can get pretty packed during the taste of Chicago, so hotels may be hard to find.  AGP is a little more than a mile away from Grant Park, but it's a nice walk with sights like The Disney Store, the Apple Store, the Tribune Building, the Chicago River, and Millenium park along the way.  It will probably be cheaper to stay on te Grant Park side of the river, though you may have problems finding a room now.  Definitely try out the Taste of Chicago because it's the best time to be in the city, but plan on going during the weekdays because the weekends can be packed and pretty overwhelming.

The King James Bible, however, is well out of copyright and therefore is in the public domain.  And many Bible companies allow nearly free use of their works for non-profit uses, such as quotes in church newsletters and so on.  But Bible companies spend a lot of money on their Bibles, and if someone takes their version and puts out a commercial version (such as an audio version) those companies should have the right to license such a use beforehand.","3","3","3","3","2","1","3","3","2","2"

Fairy tales are a way to pass lessons on to children in a way they can understand. One reason that three is a recurring theme is that some of the tales predate modern Christianity to pagan times, and most of those religions saw the number 3 as a sacred number. The Celts saw the holy trinity as Maiden, Mother, Crone. The ancient druids followed the triads which were philosophies based on the idea everything is from above, below, or here. Later the Christians viewed the number three as the Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost.

Three is a sacred number; mother, father,and child; birth, life, and death; morning, noon, and night. It is all around us.","2","1","3","2","3","3","2","2","2","3"

It takes a president who has the interests of our own security in mind, even if they go against the easier let's not fight mentality. If a democrat is elected, and we get attacked more frequently because their policies are soft, i believe people will realize what we're facing. It's not a stretch to say our way of life is at stake over the next 20 years.","Well first terrorism has not only lived for eight years I'm sure it's much longer than that.  Also what makes you think that Bush has won the war just because there hasn't been another attack?  What if they haven't tried?  For anyone to think that we have won or are winning is delusional.  For you to suggest that if the democrats were in charge we would get attacked more where do you get your statistics or where do you get your information to make such a statement.  If you make a statement like that please have something to back it up like facts and figures as to why you came up with this conclusion.  After we are gone who will be stuck the cost of this senseless war that we are not going to win.  Terrorism is not only in Iraq.  I would like to know when this administration will go after the people responsible for 9/11 I never hear bin laden out of the president's mouth.  I want the people responsible for 9/11 and I'm waiting and waiting while we waste time in Iraq where there were no mass weapons of destruction only giving opportunity for other country's to build bombs while we are doing nothing in Iraq.

Please explain your position on the issue (I admit I've been on the anti-""illegal"" immigration side but am trying to be open-minded) and then explain why your opposition's views are ignorant and/or racist?","My thoughts:  America is a wonderful country full of opportunities.  If you wish to come over here and try to make a life for yourself, be prepared to do so legally.  If you want us to treat you as citizens and give you fair rights as a citizen, you need to abide by the law.  If you are going to travel all the way over here illegally just so you can work illegally and try to reap the benefits of our nation without having to give anything back, you need to go home.  We don't have room for everyone within our borders.  If you really want a shot, work for it.

I don't think that my views are ignorant or racist at all.  I think they are fair.  Are people really pro-illegal immigration?  It's not fair to the people born here that people should cross the border illegally and then expect to be given a job, a home, and a place in society.

They are going to want an original copy  plus a copy . the original copies are the ones you get directly from the clerks office and then from that one you can have copies made. BUt be sure to get an extra original  so when you send in the original you still have one. Make sure you send exactly what is asked for to the letter. Anything missing will compeltly slow the process. The INS will not return anything. What you send will stay on file. This is why it is important to get extra originals of everything that you are sending. As a personal Id all you have to do is go to a notary public and get a notorized confirmation of your id and send that. You dont send your gov. issued id or drivers license to the INS.

Do some hotels or motels not mind?","Is it possible...yes! Is it probable, not so much. Just as a few people have mentioned, most hotels, especially the bigger, more expensive ones or the well-known chains will require you to be at least 18 and for some 21. Some of the, shall we say ""seedier"" establishments such as some locally owned motels or places known for high volumes of students coming down for high school senior week events (i.e. Ocean City, Maryland or some places in Florida) will allow some of the younger crowd to check in. I would say that your best best would be to call around and see if there are some understanding hotels/motels managers that will understand your plight, or find a friend or relative that is over the age of 18 or 21 to rent for you and see what the policies are there with that.

But when I say EVERYTHING is free, everything is free. <br/>  How did the way of money or exchanging stuff for materials come into play? Well, it was probably over thousands of years. <br/>  But still, if products were free and if the stuff the manufacturers buy were free, then the world can be really free. Why can't our lives be like that? <br/> Do you have anything to add to this.

This really shouldn't bother anyone.  I've had both sides of this plate; I've had nothing and I've had a ton.  Believe it or not, but money REALLY isn't the answer.

What news story from the past year do you feel didn’t get enough attention from the press - and why do you think it didn’t?","I think the Children of Uganda were underreported. Yes, I know Oprah did a special piece on it on her show and all and that was great, but millions of children have died. Children are surrounded by death and its inevitability too early in life. Children are taken as prisoners, forced to watch their friends and families murdered and fight civilians. They are so traumatized that there are instances where they get headaches when they don't see blood. This story really needs to be brought to light again a little more coverage so that maybe we'll be able to pressure the government for a cause worthy of some attention because as many have said, ""This kind of tragedy would not be allowed to happen in America"" and I don't think it should be allowed to happen over in Uganda either. I don't think it's being shown because America hasn't really had to face the kinds of images of the acts happening over there, but these people live them daily. America needs to take a look at what's really happening rather than turn a blind eye and act like nothing's wrong.","2","3","2","3","3","2","3","2","2","3"

Continue thw swing towards the knees and try to stand up. Chances are, you will land on your knees the first time you do it. This is a good thing.

They think that being a homosexual, pedophile, crossdresser or in favor of abortion is normal.

Mormons believe there are other books not in the ordinary bible.  This is in opposition to all Christianity, but it is particularly sensitive for evangelicals.  Evangelicals cannot give you a reason that the particular books were chosen other than to say they were written by an appropriate group.  That really isn't a reason.  They didn't pick their own books, the Catholic Church picked the New Testament.  They lack an intellectual mechanism to reject any book other than to say ""because we said so.""  They will cite bible passages, but that isn't logically valid, because of course Mormon's could do the same thing with different books.  Evangelicals cannot cite bible passages and simply win the argument.

The bible said we were created by God-self. So why why do you think that evolution means tha humans evolved from apes? We were created directly by God not through the earth. 

And doesn't the fact that microbes, germs, etc keep evolving, proves that evolution did occur?

I think the idea that species evolve over millions of years to fit its environment is logically the more ridiculous idea out there. If a species needed to adapt to its environment, it would not take millions of years to do so, because if it could survive those millions of years waiting to evolve, obviously they've already adapted enough to their environment to survive, or they would die. The only logical solution is that adaption to one's environment has to take place quick, within one generation, because if a species can survive long enough to produce the next generation obviously their environment is already hospitable to them.

We have the Bible that claims to be the word of God, we have the Quran that claims to be the word of God (and no I am not going to listen to claims that the ""true"" Bible supports the Quran).  How are we to choose between the claims?  We must look outside the two books for support (much like Newcovenant0's answer that, accept it or not, has a perception of God outside of the Bible).

Arms and crests are granted by letters patent. The Crown delegates its authority to issue such letters patent to the Kings of Arms. Before they can act in each case they must first have a warrant from the Earl Marshal agreeing to the granting of the arms. The first step in applying for a grant of arms is to submit a petition, or memorial as it is called, to the Earl Marshal. This will be drawn up for the signature of the petitioner by one of the officers of arms if it is felt probable that such a petition will be accepted. There are no fixed criteria of eligibility for a grant of arms, but such things as awards or honours from the Crown, civil or military commissions, university degrees, professional qualifications, public and charitable services, and eminence or good standing in national or local life, are taken into account.

Consequences are not as big in an atheists book of morality as they are in a Christians for example.  If an atheist breaks the rules, they hold themselves accountable and know they screwed up.

"1144932","Asset Dispositions--""Success Fees""","Mark and Jeff: There is an impression circulating among some of the commercial teams that their compensation may be directly linked to asset dispositions, ie. success fees.  Apparently, this may have started due to ""rumors"" that the London Receiver is allowing for such payments--for example, the pending Arcos turbine sale.  This is unsubstantiated, but may be worthy of inquiry.  Accordingly, in at least one domestic example, it is my understanding that the deal team was fairly unmotivated until they heard about the London ""arrangement"" and are now pursuing with great exuberance.  Maybe this is a good thing, but clearly an arrangement that needs to be vetted and then communicated so people understand what the ""rules"" may be.

Let me know how I may assist in addressing this.

"1303171","College Football Pool","We are putting together a college football pool that will run every week as well as keep an ongoing cumulative score.  The tentative plan is to have it be $100/man paid upfront with weekly payouts of 50% of the pot for the high score and rolling the other 50% of the pot into the cumulative total which pays out 3 places for the whole season (Sep 1 - Nov 24).  You will pick 5 games per week assigning each game a priority of 1-5.  All games will have the line as set by the friday edition of the U.S. Today.  The scoring will then be based on the priority values, e.g. If my 5, 3, and 2 priority games win I score 10 points for the week.   The weekly payout will be 100% to 1st place unless there is a tie, the total difference between your scores and the lines for all 5 games will be used to decide the winner.  The cumulative payout will be 50% for 1st, 30% for 2nd, and 20% for 3rd, of the remaining pot.

We are hoping to get at least 20 people which would be like $75/week and have $1000 left in the pot at the end for the cumulative leaders.  If you are interested let me know asap and also, invite whoever else you can think of, the more the better and we can maybe get the weekly payout to be more than the $100 entry fee.","3","2","3","3","2","3","3","2","2","3"

Needless to say if we pull out of this deal at this stage it will have huge ramifications with our customer and send all the wrong signals to our counterparties in this part of the world.

"1251040","New Contract System - Impact on One-part/Two-part Indicator","Please be advised that we successfully converted existing data and implemented the new contract/capacity release system for Transwestern last week.  With that, there is one change that will impact the Commercial group.  In the old CBS system, the Contract Admin group was responsible for identifying whether a contract was negotiated as a one-part or two-part rate.  Until a deal sheet is built and the new rates/revenue system is implemented, the Marketers will continue to update discounts in the existing CBS system under Negotiated Rates Maintenance.

Additionally, the Marketer will be responsible for updating within the same rate maintenance screen the one-part/two-part flag for all new firm contracts under the 'reservation' charge code.  If a contract amendment requires a change to this indicator, this must also be captured; however, be advised that this field does not have effective dates.  Therefore, if the indicator is not applicable until a future date, the one-part/two-part flag cannot be updated because the current billing will pick up this change.  I will provide any additional training if necessary regarding the loading of rates/indicators.  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

As a reminder, we have scheduled internal demos of the new system today at 1:30pm and 3pm as well as this Thursday at 1:30pm in EB3907.","3","3","3","3","3","3","2","2","3","3"

Participating for FERC were Bob Pease (enforcement att'y), Stuart Fisher (economist) and Bruce Poole (engineer).  Alan Comnes, Dave Perrino and I weighed in for Enron.  The laundry list of topics discussed is attached.  We expressed the sentiment that the root cause of all these issues and concerns is the current composition (and non-independence) of the ISO board, and suggested that the ISO board situation should be the subject of the upcoming FERC audit of ISO.  We went on to discuss the audit further and the fact that there is no established or formal comment process.  However, we were invited to file written comments with the Commission on what we thought should be audited, and Alan is taking the lead on this.  We will try to get others to sign on to the comments.  Some of the discussion items that the staff was highly interested in included:

ISO request for a bid from us to prop up the price (staff requested a copy of the transcript).

Any unexplained decreases in ATC (staff asked to be advised in real time).

The first man prayed to God, saying, ""Please God, give me the strength to cross this river."" Poof! God gave him big arms and strong legs, and he was able to swim across the river in about two hours, after almost drowning a couple of times.

Seeing this, the second man prayed to God, saying, ""Please God, give me the strength ..and the tools to cross this river."" Poof! God gave him a rowboat and he was able to row across the river in about an hour, after almost capsizing the boat a couple of times.

The third man had seen how this worked out for the other two, so he also prayed to God saying, ""Please God, give me the strength and the tools...and the intelligence ... to cross this river."" And poof! God turned him into a woman. She looked at the map, hiked upstream a couple of hundred yards, then walked across the bridge.

We haven't gotten much communication from ""above"" on spending, but everyone is doing the obvious things to be prudent right now.  I can tell you that even over this Thanksgiving weekend (with banks open on Friday), that there is still tremendous concern and focus on cash.  (I got calls at home on Friday afternoon to provide data on EA, EGM and EIM payables - data deemed critical that day).  I know that company-wide, we will want to be certain that the cancellation of the company-wide holiday party does not result in just as much money being spent by hundreds of groups across the company.

If  waiting until after mid-week makes the timing diffcult for planning purposes, I might suggest a less costly version.  One idea is to tell your directs that you want to bring them together as a group to thank them for their hard work and offer your home for the occassion on the 7th.  You could submit for expense reimbursement the cost of something like wine and beer, and ask everyone to bring a snack to contribute to the party.  I think that everyone would understand not having the entire event underwritten by Enron - especially following the events that will occur  this week.  Over the years we have all gotten used to Enron footing the bill for so many things.  At the bank where I was before, we occassionally had get-togethers where we all brought something to the party.

Prior to the transition from PG&E, we received our balance by 9:15 or 9:30 AM.  I realize that the transition has been difficult, they are never a cake walk, however, this type of information is crucial.  Further, they have not provided any final numbers for the month of April, we should at least be able to receive a ""best available"" number, and the Interstate Pipes, due to GISB, have final scheduled numbers available on the first of the month.  I submit that ENA should not be held liable for payment of the $0.03/day rate, as we have not received the information we need to balance the agreement.  If EPGT plans to administer fees, then balance information should be communicated on a timely basis.  We may want to check the terms of the agreement, and/or negotiate a reduced rate for the month of May.

"743563","Texas Comission supports prompt implementation of SPP","SPP is joining MISO and today MISO said that the merger should be filed at FERC 1Q02.  MISO also told FERC that the same congestion management systems would be used in SPP/MISO, so no seams.  Since MISO is moving toward the market design we want, then really it seems that SPP should be implementing the MISO system for Day1 (which may well be up 12/15/01) and should be right in line with MISO on Day 2 issues (that we like).

However, FERC should not approve SPP as an RTO until it is in with MISO.  I don't see that FERC needs to approve SPP as an RTO in order to allow SPP to finish work on a wholesale energy system because presumably SPP will be using MISO's system.  This summer FERC told SPP to not spend more $ since it was not an RTO yet and it was going off on its own merry way.  Therefore, FERC could say ""use MISO's system and specify exactly the minimum that needs to be done on systems in order to have the TX retail settlements done.  This should be done consistent with the no seams, as represented by MISO.""  That should satisfy Texas PUC concerns.","3","2","1","2","2","3","2","1","2","2"

"59454","Call to Bob Glynn","Per our discussion this morning, below is a summary of items to discuss with Glynn:

Adding Enron's ""negative CTC claim"" to the list of claims: PGE's filing included a list of top twenty creditors.  Our negative CTC claim was apparently not taken into account in compiling that list.  The list is nonbinding, however.  PG&E will be required to file schedules of creditors on April 20.  Our negative CTC claim should be on Schedule F (for unsecured claims).  You may want to remind Glynn of your previous conversations and state our expectation that the negative CTC claim will appear (preferably as uncontested) in the April 20 filing. (Note: if PG&E does not include the claim we have an opportunity to file a proof of claim and ultimately the court determines the validity of the claim).

Including Enron on the Creditors' Committee:  PG&E may have the opportunity to influence representation on the creditors' committees.  There are several reasons to suggest to Glynn that we be included: 1) we are a big creditor, 2) we could be helpful in crafting a broader solution, and 3) we are one of the real parties in interest behind the PX and ISO (who were listed as significant creditors but are really just ""passthroughs"" for the suppliers ... and PG&E likely would not want to have those political bodies serving on the creditors committee anyway).","2","2","2","2","2","3","2","2","2","2"

"1256360","Firing of Nolan Richardson","What an absolute embarrassment this decision is for the entire state of Arkansas and your University.  I lived in Fayetteville for many years as a child while my mother got her PhD from the University of Arkansas.  We were avid fans of the sports programs, especially basketball.  I remember as a child watching Sidney Moncrief at the old arena with my mom.  I remember stories she always told about teaching Dan Hampton as a graduate assistant.  I also remember how beautiful the landscape was in Fayetteville.  Unfortunately all of those memories are now tarnished because of the recent decisions made by you and Chancellor White.  This decision is a slap in the face to all decent Americans.  Your decision was probably based on recent tirades made by arguably the most successful coach in any sport at your University.  Coach Richardson had a phenomenal record and had gone to the tournament 15 out of 16 seasons.  I remember the awful way he was treated when he first got to Arkansas while his daughter was dying of leukemia.  I was embarrased then, but I am even more embarrased now to say that I ever called Arkansas home.  You and I will never know what it is like to walk a mile in a minorities shoes, and I think you should have cut the man some slack.  Can you not be embarrassed with what also happened at his farm last week?  You have probably done irrepairable harm to all of your athletic programs.

The walkers can be friends, family, business associates outside Enron, or co-workers.  The walkers, in turn, solicit sponsors for the walk.  As a team captain, you may also walk, of course, and Enron's top walker (from a fundraising perspective) is eligible for two free airline tickets.  Additional incentives are currently being developed.

If you are willing to serve as a team captain or a walker, please email or call Sue Wadsworth (713-853-5105) or Melissa Becker (713-853-6641).  We look forward to seeing you November 3 and demonstrating Enron's commitment to fighting heart disease.","3","3","3","3","3","2","2","3","2","3"
"1306421","Memo to RAC","Please circ to all of RAC.

I want to thank everyone for their hard work during these trying times. Lots of our efforts in the past building systems, procedures and infrastructure pay off in times like these. Feedback from both Citibank and JPM/Chase and Enron's Board members has been very positive relative to RAC. Congratulations to all.

On another note I want to caution everyone in the group from making negative statements in the presence of ours and other groups, especially more junior members of these groups. Because they come from RAC they are not considered idle commentary and can be, and have been, damaging to morale to these people. We all speculate about the state of affairs and it is a good stress relief but we can not be a part of morale reducing behavior.

Things are not back to normal but they are improving. Upon receipt of commitment from banks, hopefully later today or early tomorrow, our short term issues should be resolved. Lots of activities are underway to address medium term and long term solutions. In the mean time, keep smiling.","3","3","2","3","2","3","2","3","2","3"
"1311794","Assistants Meeting","Good question.  All cash outflows have an impact, so it is probably best just to emphasize not spending unnecessary dollars.  We have asked our direct reports to carefully consider travel (is it really necessary, and if so, can only 1 person make the trip instead of earlier times when we might have sent two or three persons), off-site meetings (can an Enron conference room work just fine), happy hours (should get approved by Mark, Greg or me ahead of time, and we need to be comfortable with business purpose), outside services and hiring.  I think that you could share this with the assistants.

It is very important, especially now, to have updated contact information for employees.  All assistants should make sure that cell and home phone numbers are up-to-date.

Please thank everyone for their focus and dedication during these tough times.  I will let you know if I think of anything else regarding spending.  --Sally

"1108804","NJ Index plus","Please see attached.  I am offering up some expanded language around the index we use so that it is more clear.  If we settle on that language, the spot energy price may need to be modified accordingly.  I am trying to make this consistent with the NY offering, which is similar in terms of how the index based price will work and what the basis will include.

I am not convinced that we can't express the basis as the ""Fixed Basis"" rather than a plug number in the EESI Energy Price definition, so I have left it the way it was.  I am also not convinced that we can do away with excess and deficiency usage calculations during the index period.

I have added in the option to fix language, but I am not sure it is necessary or desirable to have it.  It is really an optic (customers always have the right to request a restructured price) and I'm not sure there is any reason to offer it in our form unless origination has as strong market-based reason to do so.

As you may know, each year the Houston Fire Department reviews every high rise building to make sure they are in compliance with the Houston city fire code.  As part of that process, it is required by law that Enron maintain accurate records of all trained fire wardens as well as keep an ongoing list of any persons with a mobility impairment who may require special assistance during a fire drill or evacuation.  A fire drill will occur at Enron on or before December 1st.  Therefore, as trained fire wardens on your respective floors, if you know of anyone who may require special assistance during an actual fire drill or building evacuation, please forward there names to me so that I may obtain their contact information to maintain on file.  The Houston Fire Department is subject to fine Enron between $250 and $2000 for every daily violation that occurs if these records are not kept up to date.

That means that customers don't see a price signal until June and won't actually see their bill until July.  While I agree with Greg that we may see dramatic demand side response once people see their bills, we have no idea how long it will take people and businesses to adjust their behavior.  I don't really care what positions you guys want to carry.  My only advice is that Greg is short a fairly illiquid product.  If you want to get out right now you would have to pay, at least for some of your position, north of $800/MWh.  In the near term I don't think that it will be easy to get out of this trade.  In the long run, if the market comes off, it will be easy to get out.

Bottom line --

At the end of the day I think that you may be right, but things look very bullish right now.

Just to clarify things, we are settling MPC's Choice customers Energy Imbalance position, and PP&L Montana has the right to any length resulting from MPC's ""domestic"" load Energy Imbalance.  In other words MPC is settling two separate Energy Imbalance accounts, so during the hour they may be turning energy back to PP&L Montana, while at the same time finding themselves short for the Choice loads.  During the recent bullish pricing conditions, Choice customer were leaving themselves long, as of late, MPC is experiencing the Choice customers doing the opposite, positioning themselves short.  The net result is that MPC will most likely be expecting us to fill a short position from this point on, so I'd really like to see what we can do to honor their requests, mindful of the favorable position we've enjoyed over the last several months.

Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.

I talked to a guy in the Enron liquids group who said that 2-oil tankage in the Caribbean goes for about $0.25- $0.30 per barrel per month.  If we leased them only 150,000 bbls of capacity in the tank and kept the rest for ourselves, that would be around $40,000/month.  The actual number could be whatever we are comfortable with keeping in storage as minimums.  If we could get something out of it every month and still sell them our inventory that would be great.  But I would also like to know how it looks in case they wouldn't go for that and we had to hold title to whatever oil we already have in the tank. Then we could still have some sort of pricing mechanism for buying and selling oil to each other in the tank.

From what I heard from Peerless, they would plan to unload vessels into Eco's tank, then transfer out of that tank to their other tanks when needed.

Generally, I put them out there initially with a 2 cent two way until the market gets moving a bit and then tighten keystone up to 1 or 1.5 cents.  All the products should be set to offset to last trade(usually a penny).  Then I just adjust the offset depending on how fast I think the market is moving.  The market tends to get really slow by 9:15, so by then, I'm back to a 2 cent two-way at keystone and a 3 cent two-way at the border.  These markets will still be tighter than ICE.  Also just a reminder, we have 8000 of the Waha gas to sell to the Texas desk.  All transport should be in position already.  Jason may talk to you about moving some of his transport out of Keystone, but not likely.  I would expect that we would probably want to go about 50,000 long for tuesday and then wednesday.

- It has come to my attention that some groups (back office) have been told that each individual within their group can elect to be part of the Estate or of NewCo. This is surprising to me. No such election has been offered to anyone in EnronOnline (nor do I think it would make sense to offer that), but before I tell people they do not have a choice, I wanted to check with you.  - ?

- On the issue of bonuses: The numbers we put together made sense to me in the context of an annual  bonus with some element of retention mixed in. According to the auctions documents I looked at, retention is identified as being for a 1 year period, with 1/2 of the amount paid up front and 1/2 one year later. If this is the case, it significantly changes the complexion (i.e. more like a retention payment with an element of bonus, rather than bonus with an element of retention) and we should revisit the numbers.

"1258079","TRPA Park Place Entertainment Deal","Operations approves this transaction with the following notations:

1)  This is an approval for this deal only, and should not be taken as a blanket approval of additional retail deals.  Any additional retail deal should be separately considered through the TRPA process.

2)  UBSW Energy's processes and systems are designed to handle wholesale commodity transactions.  This single transaction will not suport the cost of system enhancements or changes to accommodate a retail deal.  Therefore, certain operational functions will be handled manually, and as such, are subject to a potential human error rate and reconciliation process that comes with the manual manipulation of data.  The Operations team will put the necessary additional checks and balances in place to mitigate these risks, but it should be noted that the risk of data errors will be inherently increased as a result of manual processes for a one-off transaction.

3)  The Operations team currently has the capacity to service this one-off, manually intensive transaction due to unused capacity in place to service UBSW Energy wholesale business.  When the wholesale business is once again in full swing, it is possible that the current Operations resources will be insufficient to service both the wholesale business and this one retail deal.  Appropriate headcount additions would be presented on a business need basis.","3","1","1","1","2","2","2","3","2","2"

"1135556","Water","I like it for 2 reasons:

1.    The dust has not yet settled on all of our ERCs for Roseville.  There are still fantasy issues that EPA and others are thinking about, which if implemented, will  make some of the ERC deals we have at best uneconomical.

2.    If we got this ""gift"", it would be nice to be able to sell the ERCs we have so that we can reduce our out of pocket exposure during these fun times.  Frankly, if Leslie's idea became law, these ERCs could be sold to projects who did not have access to the waste water that we do, thus facilitating additional new power plant devleopment for the benefit of the state.

Having said all of the above, I have my doubts that something like this would have a chance of working out.  The little people in the environmental community have absolutely no concept of the big picture, being instead more worried about detail process over global results.  I think that this thing would get bogged down in the reality that projects would get ERCs, but the net result would be a short term decrease in air quality in the local air basin due to not applying specific, coincident ERCs to specific projects.  The little people probably cannot get their head around that, even though the very clean modern plants one day would put out of business dirtier, less efficient plants, thus resulting in a net improvement in air quality in the state.","1","2","1","1","3","2","2","3","3","3"

Alan Comnes

Beginning at 2359 on December 12, 2001, the ISO will alter the way it  pays inter-tie bids for Energy.  Specifically, the ISO (1) will continue to pre-dispatch an inter-tie bid in merit order in the BEEP stack before the beginning of the operating hour but (2) now ensure such a bid is dispatched throughout the entire operating hour (i.e., never reversed), thus paying the bid the Instructed Energy Price for all ten-minute intervals in that hour.

"1282143","Market Based Rate (MBR) Position Piece for EPSA--Calll Notes and the Latest Draft","Looks good.  I agree that making arguments about merchant generation ""stranded costs"" is questionable, better to couch this as ""structural impact on market participants"".  More importantly, if I bought 50% of generation in one market, and FERC changes their rules, seems like I either (a) sell generation and take the loss or (b) get regulatory risk insurance.  FERC has the right to make markets work.

Finally, on the issue of blanket authority, I think that the CAISO model is a good example of why this may not work for Enron.  In the long-run, as a market-maker, Enron needs workable markets.  A good test case would have been this - under FERC's proposed rules, would FERC have granted market-wide waiver in California?  If FERC is comfortable with the result, than move ahead.

"58917","Still working on it but here's where we are","We can talk about it at 10:00am, however, I do not think the split will work as you propose. The vast majority of the industrial process load uses more than 25 MW on peak which is and should continue to be the focus of ENA. The target companies and sites we will focus on down here will  average somewhere in the 10-20 MW peak range(remember, non-process load, aggregation of sites).

After EES bought back the minority shareholders, there has been increasing overlap in the marketplace between EES/ENA. The reasoning behind deliniating where and how each group will focus was to alleviate the external overlap, reduce any friction between the groups, and increase both groups productivity.

Given our financial situation we did not do any fixed price physical transactions for December so we have no trades to report this month.  Hopefully our situation we be resolved soon so that we can be a part of the process in the near future.  For whatever it is worth, it that there are some unusual things happening in the ""Fixed Float"" markets in Texas particularily at HSC.  The NYMEX is down 10 cents today yet the HSC fixed float market went from plus 2 cents or $2.336 to $2.345 yesterday to now $2.36 with the Henry Hub also appearing to be inflated by maintaining a fixed float value of $2.31 again in a falling market.  We feel like we are defenseless because we have no trades to report and yet have basis and Gas Daily positions and some trade players know it so they are inflating the prices to hurt us more financially.  I have no evidence since I was not a participant in the fixed price physical market this month all I am asking is that you be extra vigilant in determining the validity of the transactions that are being submitted for index consideration.

Your commitment and fortitude under trying circumstances is always steady and going forward. During all the past years of success and truly phenomenal growth I along with my co-workers have been richly rewarded.   Not only was I rewarded economically but also my friends and superiors contributed huge amounts of time and money toward others less fortunate and able to help themselves.

This is a direct reflection of your leadership and your giving back to the community.  This leadership by example is what will sustain us in the coming months as we build our stock back up.  I have no doubt build it up we will.  There is nothing more invigorating than a challenge to show your true courage and ambition. Shifting blame and finding scapegoats has never been your style and I am very glad to see we are not starting down that road.  I feel the up coming Chairman's Award will be a great boost to morale.

People measure success very differently. I feel just as successful today as a year ago because I answer to a higher authority than our stock price. Enron's helping of our neighbors during the floods and the New Yorkers during their tragedies makes me very proud to work at this company.  Time is a better indicator of how well we persevered during these rather tumultuous times.  Here's to a better view in two thousand two.

Significant New Issuance - CSFB Commentary:

The first week of September was extremely positive for the region with a significant increase in secondary trading volumes and bond prices. Relative financial stabilisation in Argentina removed pressure from Latin American and other emerging markets, shifting the focus to the impact of local factors on prices in each region. It was a busy week in the Turkish market, which started initially on a weaker note because of the disappointing inflation data released on Monday, but then recovered to follow other Eastern European markets and closed around 1.5 points higher on the week. The long awaited resignation of the Minister of Public Works added to the positive sentiment in the market. The Russian market rallied this week, first on the back of Latam stabilisation and then encouraged by the Moody's rating upgrade (see below). Prices peaked on Thursday, immediately after the upgrade, but failed to stay at those levels due to profit taking and a sliding Latam market, closing only one point higher than last Friday. Central and Eastern European investment grade assets remained stable throughout the week, which is a good sign given the sell-off in US Treasuries. Other countries in this region gained around  point, with Romania being the best performer gaining  point.

On Wednesday, Moody's raised the ratings of outstanding Eurobonds of the Russian Federation to B2 from B3 and changed the outlook for all hard currency instruments to ""positive"" from ""stable."" Moody's noted that Russia's recent economic performance and tax reforms have generated twin surpluses (current account and budget) and large foreign currency reserves. In combination with some debt relief, these factors have made the country's capacity to service its debt much greater.","2","3","2","3","2","3","2","1","2","2"

"1107392","<<Concur Expense Document>> - MW100901","Barry,

The Jackson Hole Lodging (Huff House) for Mark and Paul was all charged on Mark's card.  The way the lodging was broken up is as follows: 2 rooms, 2 night stay, $215.00 per night per room + 6% tax.  So, actual charges for Mark Whitt was $455.80, and for Paul Lucci was $455.80, for a grand total of $911.60.

Paul has not given me his receipts from this trip just yet, but the only major travel associated charges he should have to expense would be airfare, which was $251.50. As Mark also had the rental car charged to his expenses.

"1311817","December Newsletter","Since this is my work e-mail address, I enjoyed a much overdue break from Enron Wednesday through Sunday, so I did not read your e-mail message until today.

Unfortunately, I can't read anything, but hopefully Nancy was able to review it.

I realized today that the article that Lori Ewalt gave me in hard copy at the board meeting is still in my NCL folder.  I meant to retype and get this to you in a word attachment, but frankly the hours at Enron have been horrific.  I worked the weekends of November 10 and 17 (Sat and Sun), and have had very long hours during the week - latest one on record to date was 1:00 AM last Tuesday.

"276672","Enron Law Conference","Jim, I am so glad that the 2001 law conference went so well -- we have received many favorable comments from the attendees.  Today we had a post-conference meeting with the group that worked on the conference, and we went over what worked well and what didn't.  It was very productive.

One of the things that came out of our meeting was the need to promptly appoint next year's Chairman of the CLE committee.  Michelle feels that putting that person in place now will greatly aid in the transition from this year to next year's planning.  As a matter of fact, she is meeting with her committee for the last time next week and would love to announce the new chair at that time.

So, could you please think about to whom you would like to give that distinct honor?  I've asked Michelle to e-mail you information about her committee and her suggestions regarding a chair.

"1108647","CA Labels","It's that time of year again - sending out 3rd quarter labels to California.  Richard & I were talking this morning and had several questions.

First - how do we reflect to our customers that used to receive BIZMIX (large commercials) in their projected labels that for the first month of the year (according to Diann Hudleston they were initially de-DASRed on Jan 31) they received the BIZMIX fuel mix and for the rest of the year the system mix?  Do we need to do a label showing a column for the Jan mix and a column for the rest of year mix with a footnote?  Additionally, has Peggy Mahoney's letter gone out yet?  I'd hate for a notation on a label to be the first thing a customer sees about this.  There is a bit of time, however, as these will go out in the October billing cycle (CSC has to have them 9/10).

Second - We returned our residential customers to the utilities the end of June.  Do we still need to send them a projected 2001 label in 3rd & 4th quarters since we did not provide their electricity during those periods?  I presume we will, however, have to send them a historical 2001 label next spring, since we did provide their electricity for at least first half of the year.

Thanks.","2","3","2","3","3","2","2","3","1","2"
"742810","Enron Letter to Mike Gent","Jose

In the cover letter to Mike Gent to transmit our Enron SSO document, it would be good to flag to Mike that Enron will participate in any forum to discuss the formation of an SSO.  This will prevent NERC from trying to splinter EPSA members on the EISB vs NERC issue,  and claim that Enron has endorsed NERC as the SSO. We need to make clear to NERC they are not the only sandbox we will be playing in to form an SSO.  We need to safeguard our ability to keep feet on both sides of the fence.

The strategy I have been pursuing for the past 6 months has been one of keeping competition out there for SSO status.  Our support of EISB has resulted in some good changes at NERC as seen last week.  Of course we are nowhere near finished.  We need to keep the competition going between NERC and EISB now more than ever since it is likely that without competition, NERC will spinmeister all its actions as broad-based consensus and sell that to FERC and the Hill.

My new focus is to maintain support for an EISB formation that is open and inclusive so that NERC will be challenged to demonstrate its reformation process (possibly through a Blue Ribbon Panel?) is as open and inclusive as EISB's.  EPSA plans to take up DOE's offer to sponsor a forum to form the 4th quadrant of EISB and we should participate in that forum.  If NERC cannot tout its process is as open and inclusive as any other, they will lose the fight.","2","3","3","3","2","3","3","2","2","3"
"759891","SPP Retail Market Opening Testimony","AEP asked the Texas PUC to postpone opening the Texas (outside of ERCOT) retail market because there is no centralized dispatch (per Ron M's testimony on behalf on AEP).  After talking with our SPP folks (I understand that EPMI has bid to serve a portion of Entergy's load) , Jim's testimony is that the outside of ERCOT Texas market should open 1/1/02 and that other states have implemented retail open access without a centralized dispatch model (for example, AEP in Ohio, ComEd in Ilinois and Duquense in ECAR/PA).  Jim states that while RTOs and central dispatch will certainly facilitate the market, it is not absolutely required, and that, if AEP thinks that the retail market will not be competitive without it, then, perhaps, REPS other than AEP should be the only ones allowed to serve retail load in this part of Texas until central dispatch is in place.  In addition, he states that the imbalance provisions should be changed and that network firm capacity should be available to REPs (without the need for protracted system impact studies, since the load is already being served.)

Apparently, Entergy has also changed its mind and now is opposing the 1/1/02 opening of the Entergy/Texas retail market.","2","1","1","1","1","1","1","2","1","1"
"888705","November 1st Gas Issues Conference Call-- 3:30 p.m.","Some background on this issue:  It has been a hot topic at GISB for a number of months now.  It was first raised by AGA and a few LDCs (Brooklyn Union, in particular) in a rehearing request on one of the proceedings where a pipeline was filing compliance with Order 587 (the order requiring compliance with GISB).  GISB moved the issue into one of the committees, and the LDCs and a few marketers have been fighting over it ever since.  I understand that some pipelines side with the LDCs and some of them don't feel strongly about it one way or the other.  Ultimately, GISB reported to FERC that they weren't able to resolve the issue due to the conflicting viewpoints of the various segments.  Thus, the NOPR.

Input from the traders is that they don't have objections to Partial Day Recalls as long as we know the capacity is released with that right reserved, so we can value our bids accordingly.  Leslie is going to write a short pleading to emphasize this position and point out that releasing shippers should be able to specify whether or not they intended to make the release subject to partial day recalls.  It shouldn't be a big deal, because they now have to specify whether or not they are subject to the current recall provisions.  It was not spelled out in the NOPR.

We will talk to Joe, but I've been told the Enron pipelines are not too concerned about it.

By the way, I had to join Brian Redmond for a conference call yesterday at 2:30, so I couldn't join the EPSA call.  It sounds like they haven't decided whether to file or not.","1","1","1","1","2","2","2","2","3","2"

"773643","FLOOR MEETING","At the Global Accounting Leadership Conference a few weeks ago, Rick Causey conducted a ""group conversation"" in which he discussed several topics that he knew would be of interest to the group and fielded questions from the group on a variety of topics.  All of this was done in a very informal setting, with a free flow of information between Rick and the participants.  The attendees agreed this was a very good forum for communication.

I would like to give the entire Tax department the same opportunity.  Rick has scheduled October 30th from 2:00 - 3:00 p.m. in EB1701.  Since space is limited, please reserve a spot by contacting Bobbie Moody via email only.  If more people sign up than the room will comfortably hold, we will schedule an additional meeting(s).

ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.

Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

"275683","Additional New Works; 5/2/01 Floor Meeting, 37th Floor","In order to maximize the potential synergies between the various mid- and back- office functions, to decrease replication errors, and to increase communication standards; are there any plans of creating a platform or reference center to bridge the differences between the systems, processes, and terminology of the various departments. Perhaps a common resource center offering access to on-line system manuals and business unit overviews (which currently exist only in paper form or in some cases within the actual system database).

The reason: With Enron's size and transaction volume, many of the functions and the data managed by various groups within Enron (i.e. credit, risk, settlements, volume management, global contracts, global counterparties, global rates, and the commercial systems) are fragmented. Having participated in various process reviews and trouble-shooting/clean-up projects there seems to be a large disconnect between groups operating in various systems. These disconnects; rather they be lack of information or understanding of how data flows between systems, how the data managed within each system impacts other upstream or downstream systems, or how the business processes within one group/system impacts the overall functionality of other groups, create large cracks producing an opportunity for mismanaged data, incomplete business reports, and increased risk to Enron.

The ideal objective; increase communication standards through a better understanding of system data functions/requirements and business processes, decrease system downtime and replication errors through a better understanding of the data relationships between systems, maximize department-to-department synergies (left hand knows what the right hand is doing), eliminate repetition, and further reduce potential risks to Enron due to information/business process oversight.","2","3","2","3","2","2","3","3","3","3"

In a car parked in the circle drive was a young man about 20 years old of Middle Eastern decent taking pictures of the Enron building and the 3 Allen Center.  Security was at the scene and asked the young man to stop taking the pictures, he got back in his car and continued to take the pictures.  My husband wrote down the license plate number and make of the car and gave this information to security.  Security informed us that they would take care of the situation. I spoke to security this morning and they do not have any report of this incident or the police being notified.   Mr. Lay with everything that has happened to this country I am scared that something may happen to us.  I would like to think I can come to work and be safe, but with security not taking instances such as Friday seriously I have doubts.

EOL has been set up to have a trader associated with one and only one trading book in the stack manager. As a result, when creating the interface between EOL and Enpower we can cannot assign multiple trading books to one person. David Poston in the Enpower IT support group in Houston has been working with the EOL group and has come up with a solution.

1. If you definitely plan to be trading on EOL for all trading books associated with your name, EOL IT can define certain products to each trading book. If this is the approach that you would like to take, I will need a list of what products you want to trade and to which trading book they are affiliated with.

2. The other option is that you will just use one trading book under your name. If that is the case, no changes will have to be made.

If the plan is to use the first option, please let me know so we can make the changes and do the necessary testing on this.","3","2","2","3","2","3","3","2","2","3"
"1257895","Hello from a long lost friend","Paul,

I hope this is the right address. I ran into Kristian and Monica the other day, got Kristian's card, and promptly lost it. I am going solely on my formidable memory of the address. Sounds like you guys had a bigger freak show there than we did here. What an incredible story. Hopefully neither of us will have to go through that again. I'm out of the office here and heading down to Houston to trade gas. It's west basis, so I should be able to draw on my power knowledge a little bit. Things got a little crazy here, will have to tell you more over several beers, I think that is the minimum it will take. Erica is excited for a change, although Houston is not her first choice, she's a trooper and will find fun things to do. How is Sarah doing? I hope she and the baby have made it through all the changes. There is a woman here who I think would be interested in coming to London. She is young (only 23) but has raw talent. She started here last summer working in the California book. Let me know if you could use a hand, as I said, she has raw talent and drive. Thats all from here. Stay in touch and say hello to Sarah.

ONEOK/Response to ONEOK's Request for a Special Test","One of the to-do's at the end of our recent conference call was to determine whether we wanted to do an end-run around ONEOK's desire to use the PTR system during the special test by buying or leasing a meter to use in place of the rich inlet meter.  Don Hawkins just called to advise that Phil Lowry has authorized spending $100,000 to buy a new meter and associated piping for this purpose.

"62531","More Portland Issues","Here is a trade for you.  According to the Master Agreement, all technology equipment on Schedule 27 was being conveyed to UBS.  All FF&E on Schedule 18 was not.  It turns out that the Estate in Portland needs some of the technology equipment on Schedule 27.  This includes servers, computers, printers, etc.  We need some of the stuff on Schedule 18 such as the desks and chairs.  We are guaranteed use of this stuff so long as we stay in this building.  Therefore, we could use it forever for free if we chose to stay here.  It seems that we have a fair trade here.  If you don't convey this equipment to us the only effect is that you will likely prevent us from moving as it will be too expensive!!!  An option to buy the equipment from the estate is essentially a worthless option.  The furiture will have little value to the estate and may be a liability as demand for that stuff in Portland is low and the cost to move is high (e.g., in Mexico shutting down the office cost $40k plus storage fees to move furniture into storage).  Furthermore, I have no reason to believe that an accounting firm working for the estate will give us a ""fair"" value on the furniture.  We don't want any furniture from the 4th floor that the estate will need.  Bottom line, we can give the estate computers and servers and they can keep the fourth floor furniture and everything will work well for them.  We give up some computers and servers to the estate but keep the furniture on the 3rd floor.  Everyone is happy and it makes economic sense.

Let's just do this trade that makes sense for everybody.","2","3","3","3","1","2","2","1","2","1"
"743076","Summary or PX Credit Proposals","An update from the meeting we had with SCE on August 9:  SCE said that it has TEMPORARILY stopped charging CTC because it doesn't know what to charge for DWR. Meanwhile, it continues to keep track of the dollar flows through the TCBA and the new account set up for DWR.  Once the CPUC decides on the DWR's revenue requirement, SCE expects that it will charge generation-related CTC again.  There is also continuing CTC related to QF contracts that will return (and goes beyond 3/31/02) once QF contracts are above the ""market"".  SCE is also considering filing a petition with the CPUC to get guidance on all these matters. Once the CPUC rules on SCE""s advice letter approaches, SCE plans to go back and re-bill begining with Jan 18 (it used some different PX credit approaches early on and switched to this approach for bills going out June 4). I didn't ask the question about calculating CTC back to Jan 18.  I guess if the DWR rev req is retroactive and leaves room for CTC, they will bill it.  The other twist I had forgotten about is that they have a one-half cent charge added to the embedded gen rate of 10.27 cents (making it about 10.77 cents) that collects the $400 million that was uncollected while the CPUC played around with a rate design for the three cent surcharge.  The half cent addition is for 12 months.","1","1","1","1","2","2","1","1","2","1"
"1278710","","So far this quarter we've spend about 18 million on a reserve that Randy Petersen/Credit are making us take on an option we have associated with the MTBE project.  In essence, Randy P doesn't understand how we trade options at Enron, and I'll be having a conversation with Rick about this.  We've spent almost 5 million in getting out of physical positions since no one will buy from or sell to us.  We can't manage the physical positions and obligations we have since there is no money available to the crude group (to purchase physical or post LC's in the case of a sale).  Wev'e also spent about 10+ million closing down books and getting out of positions as the market gives us the chance.  More than half the books have been closed and we will close/consolidate four more tonight.  As you know, getting out of any positions costs money, and the market smells blood.

Because the crude and products markets have been moving significantly recently, we can't manage our options position by getting out of them.  Again, nobody will buy from us or sell options to us, so we have to try to neg. gamma trade it.

That is the 30 second version of the cluster I'm trying to close, hope it helps.

"1105590","Increase in Demand for Brokerage Agreements","Sara:

How much protection do the agreements give us?  I have always assumed that they were primarily for the benefit of the brokers.  Of course, in the U.S. they are probably required by the SEC and in a country where they are not required you have to wonder how well the brokers are being policed by regulators.  I guess it makes sense to at least contact local counsel to find out what protections there are for the customer and whether or not it would be reasonable to ask for something in writing.  I don't think we need written opinions of counsel.  It might also make sense to explain to the business folks that we think there is incrementally greater legal risk in using those arrangements and that while they may be permitted to use them they should keep activities to a minimum where there is a more secure alternative.

"1034017","PEER GROUP MAPPING","Steve Kean and I believe quite strongly, within a four peer group structure,  that we need to allocate somewhere between 30 and 50 percent of Gov't./ public  Affairs out of commercial support into specialized technical- there is a clear divide between individuals in the Gov't/public  Affairs groups  who are managing significant risk for the company and having a significant and  direct impact on commercial activities/ net income( these individuals should be moved to specialized technical)....and others who are performing a less strategic function( who should remain in the commercial support category). With that said, it is probably not necessary to undertake this effort for  mid-year PRC purposes since we are probably moving to a three peer stucture where that split could be achieved (for year-end purposes where the compensation impact would be felt). If we stay with the four group stucture, I intend to push hard for the remapping of Gov't Affairs by year-end.

On a completely seperate issue, I continue to be  very concerned about the impact of the ""preferred"" distribution  relative to the bottom category for "" commercial support"" groups(I'm not implying this is'nt an issue for commercial groups- I just don't have the same ability to assess the impact there)....the concern, simply stated,  is that  it may be entirely  counterproductive to force individuals who are not performance problems  into a category that has significant implications for their careers here at Enron, particularly after going thru the past year where many of the non-performers in my group and others  were moved out of the company- the replacement costs for moving good performers out of the company for the sake of a ""preferred"" distribution are quite high...and that is even before you begin  to assess the incalcuable damage to morale that will invariably occour.

"1313038","Arctic Outbreak Forecast","Arctic Outbreak Forecast      Issued:   08:00 PM Saturday November 24, 2001   Surge of Arctic Air Possible    Cold air under strong high pressure is poised to move south from the Arctic regions of Canada and Siberia this coming week. By normal standards, this air will not be all that cold, considering it is of Arctic origin. But, considering the time of year and how unseasonably warm it has been recently, this punch of Arctic air will bring an abrupt change for most of the week ahead.   A deep trough of low pressure, currently digging into the southwest U.S. will traverse the central states early this week, opening the gates behind to the air that is pooled in northern Canada. Beginning late Sunday or early Monday, the Arctic front will begin its plunge into the lower 48, reaching the Gulf Coast overnight Monday night.   The potential is for temperatures, across all the eastern half of the U.S., except Florida, to plummet as much as 30 degrees from Tuesday to Thursday, but the coldest nights could be later in the week as the skies clear. For Florida, the greatest temperature changes won't come until the weekend.   On a more uncertain note, there are also early indications of possible winter weather after midweek from east Texas across northern Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and northward into the Midwest.   We will continue to monitor this developing weather situation and the potential for winter weather.

Bob is the director of Gas Logistics for Enron Americas, and attended the lunch meeting that I held yesterday.  I asked all in attendance to let me know if they had ideas on things that could be done to improve employee morale.  I can always count on Bob to give thoughtful consideration to this type of request.  Here are his ideas.  Some of these I can orchestrate for my operations team and the broader Enron Net Works employee base.  Some of these suggestions could impact a broader base of employees.  I would be happy to lead any or all of these efforts on an Enron-wide basis is you think that would be appropriate.  I could certainly use some help, however.

You may already have a venue for this, but maybe it would be a good idea to put together a small team of interested individuals (like Bob Superty) who could make suggestions in the short run on ideas that could improve employee morale.  Not a formalized committee, and not even one that would have to be announced or publicized.  Just an ad hoc group to make a difference now.  Maybe this doesn't have to be corporate wide.  Maybe each business unit could put together an ad hoc group, if they feel that it is appropriate for their business unit, and maybe these various ad hoc groups could just share ideas.  This might be even more effective with buy-in and initiative from the business units, rather than the feel of a corporate overlay.  As I am typing, I am thinking that maybe we will pilot this in Enron Net Works and simply share what we are doing with others.","2","2","2","2","1","2","1","1","2","1"

This should be communicated to all parties in writing in the near future (see MOU Sec 17 re good faith intent of the parties regarding the MOU transactions).   In light of the non-binding nature of the MOU, it seems reasonable to go forward with the group under the proposed terms, even though Drew has prepared extensive comments on the MOU to introduce the Non-Developing Partner concept.

We were using historical rates (no fuel adjustment because we collect it in fuel sales) through 2006.  After 2006, I calculated an adjustment to add to the historical rates (assuming that we would recapture some of the value of the spread in the rate) and it made the rate greater than the max tariff rate.  Davis and I discussed that we didn't think we should assume anything in the models over max rate, so Davis said he would cap the rate at max, after 2006.

With Savita assuming the role previously played by Sheri with regard to the Product Control group, I wanted to underscore the importance of a free flow of information between the EOL team and my operations team.  One of the roles that Sheri's team fulfilled was keeping my risk and operations teams apprised of any changes within EOL that can have an impact on bridging to our legacy systems.  I may have met Savita once in passing.  I checked with Jeff Gossett and Stacey White, risk leads over gas and power, respectively, and neither one has heard of or met Savita.  Although Jennifer Denney will play an active role, I know that she will be out on maternity leave soon, so it is important for Savita to know the right players on the operations team and for them to know her.  I will contact Savita directly to make the appropriate introductions.  I just wanted your support and encouragement for Savita in making the right connections within operations.  --Sally","3","2","1","2","2","1","1","2","2","1"
"1109027","PX Committee","One the chance you are retrieving messages I wanted to update you on my conversations with some PX committee members about the arbitration issue.  At the moment, in addition to APX and Power Exchange, Avista and perhaps Marant seem to support the idea.  I do not know the positions of Reliant, Sempra and Salton Sea.  Both Avista and Marant feel that something needs to be done because (1) Edison seems to be blowing us off and (2) the legislature does not seem to be coming up with a solution that helps the power generators.  There thought is that it wouldn't really hurt and probably will help to put some pressure on.  Avista likes the idea of addressing the issue through a committee and its counsel.  They think that there is strength in numbers and like the ability to share the cost of one counsel.  They seem reasonably satisfied with the job Kaye, Scholer is doing.  However, Avista doesn't think that this major a step should be taken on a 5 to 4 vote of the committee if that's where things are.  Are you prepared to argue the reasons for deferring action against Edison?","3","2","2","3","1","3","2","2","1","1"

Frank departed for the day due to illness and our 2:00 p.m. meeting did not occur.  It is not my agenda to create a 3-way problem specific to a customer, yet this customer happens to be the NE in a singular bundle.

"1137382","Proposal for 2002 Purchase","Thanks - that's what I needed to know.  I'm still not sure if it is a two-way termination (yes I know the difference) because there's no language that indicates we'd be paid if we're in the money in a termination.  There is a provision that allows us to cease delivery ""by reason of ... significant change in operating condition""; if we don't deliver, there's an LD calculation, which if positive, we have to pay.  There doesn't appear to be any language that causes WEPCo to pay us if we don't deliver and we're in the money.  (Hence my question to David) Otherwise, the only way to terminate is with one year's advance written notice - there are no Event of Default provisions and remedies, such as for bankruptcy. (Which I'm assuming you know since you're familiar with the contract).  What I didn't know was your longer term view of the market - this obviously matters in evaluating their offer if the contract is one way and we are unhedged.  In any event, for now they can either pay us the $1.2 million or we'll plan on delivering in January.  I'll call them onWed and let you know so we can schedule delivery is necessary.","1","1","1","1","3","3","1","1","1","1"

When confronted by pipeline employees, the individuals said they were lost and asked for directions.  Upon departing, the individuals did not follow the provided directions.  On one occasion, employees obtained the car license number, and the individual was detained by the FBI and is awaiting a deportation hearing.  Both of these events were reported to local FBI offices.  It is not known if the two events were connected.

"1336608","","Ken- I am a Director at EES and have been at Enron for 9 years. I am extremely proud of Enron and our many successes. The creativity and collective brainpower at Enron is unmatched in the industry. I attended the All Employee meeting you held before I left for vacation.  I left with a strengthened resolve and commitment to Enron. I thought a lot about your very effective handling of the issues in front of us. I am extremely disappointed in many of the prevailing negative attitudes internally and particularly some of the terribly disrespectful questions and comments thrown at you in the meeting. You as always handled the situation with grace, humor and poise. You have tremendous support internally despite what I perceive to be a relatively spoiled group of people who have no concept how good we all have it despite our current issues. I have total faith in our management team and am happy to see a very proactive offensive underway. Thank you for your commitment to Enron and know that many of us long term employees know from experience we will beat these challenges.

"1336569","A dissapointed stockholder","I have been an Enron stockholder for several years  and I am very disappointed with the events of the last two weeks.  I find  the allegations of accounting irregularities incredible.  I would like to  know how closely the board had been monitoring the activities of the CFO and  whether it approved the partnerships that have led to the SEC investigation and  the dramatic decline in the company's stock price.  I would suggest that  the compensation of senior management may be too heavily weighted towards  bonuses (giving some the incentive to manipulate the numbers to increase their  bonuses) and not heavily weighted enough towards stock options.  I would  hope in the future the goals of the board and senior management will be aligned  with stockholders (increasing shareholder value).  While I know it is not  reason to have expected the stock price to stay in the high 80s, I consider the  drop in the last two weeks (apparently as the result of fraud) to be  inexcusable.  I believe the board owes all stockholders an explanation that  will finally clear the air about this mess (maybe the markets will trust Enron  again if it replaces evasion with candor).  Please help return credibility  and ethics to this company, which apparently are badly needed.

I have met and spent time with the CEO of S&P.  I know him through Michael Lewan, one of our DC consultants.  You may know of that S&P is owned by McGraw Hill.  Michael Lewan gave the ""Steve Kean"" (and #3) of McGraw Hill his very first job in life.  Glenn then introduced me to the CEO of S&P, Leo O'Neill.  Leo is a very approachable person who readily made acquaintances with me b/c of his great fondness for Bob Rubin and Michael Lewan.  Leo told me several stories of how he always ""thinks better of"" the CEOs who sit down with him and engage in honest conversation when S&P is evaluating its ratings of a company.  That is how Leo got to know Bob; Leo was very impressed with how Bob acted when S&P was contemplating action against Goldman Sachs many years ago.  Second, the recently resigned Head of Enforcement of the SEC is a friend from my gym.  For several years I spent most mornings with him as we shared the same personal trainer.  I am sure Richard hired most if not all of the current SEC enforcement staff.

He expresses keen interest, but his heart seems to be in Canada.  He has committed to come to some career conclusions within the next week or two.

We've also been speaking with Heather Kendall, a director who works for Gary Hickerson in London helping to roll-up the Ag business.  I've worked with her before, and she would be great for EnronOnline's efforts at gaining traction in new products, marketing and origination out of London.  Her issue is wanting to come back to Houston at some point.  I suppose I need your help in 2 ways.

Second, if you are familiar with anyone else in London with deep Enron background and broad commercial shoulders who's looking for an open lane, we need to talk to them.

"1275250","Possible press release before market open on 11/20/01","First version:  First paragraph probably falls under the requirements of SEC Regulation M-A (communications regarding the Enron/Dynegy merger).  This could be viewed as soliciting support for the merger (""merger is in the best interests of shreholders.."" etc.).  As such, it would have to include the Rule 425 legend and be filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 425 (unless you can argue that the reference to the merger is only in a non-substantive way---it doesn't read that way to me).  Also, the reference in that same first paragraph to ""powerful competitor"" may not sit well with the FTC with respect to the antitrust issues (probably not fatal, but we ought to think of another desciptive word).

Second version:  Technically, I would say ""secured"" by, as opposed to ""supported"" by the assets of the pipelines when referring to the credit support for the facilities.  Second paragraph:  Same comments as the first paragraph in the first version addressed above.  Third paragraph:  I don't think it is a good idea to talk about ""strong verbal indications"" regarding the extension of maturities unless you are just about 100% confident that they will, in fact, be extended.  I think we are sending a message by such a statement that this maturity will be extended.  If there is a chance that it will not, I think this is a risky statement to make.  If it is made, perhaps we should include a forward looking statement factor to the effect ""factors include Enron's ability to restructure scheduled maturities of debt""  (but my first choice would be not to include the quote).

These volumes are coming through the Supply verifications and Sales invoices but are not being paid, nor being sent out and therefore creating issues for Settlements.   I remember that Sylvia Campos had stated that those tickets were not possible to put in because Nicor is an Hub not a storage facility.  My Nicor rep. faxed me copies of their tariff effective July15, 1999 stating they have the capacity for storage and transportation, so I'm a little confused what the problem is that is preventing us setting Nicor up correctly in global and Unify to handle these types of storage deals individually.

Any assistance with this would be greatly appreciated as we are showing a $4 million receivable outstanding for settlements and a $1.1 million payable on the service side and need to get these cleared as soon as possible.  I can make a copy of the tariff that I have just let me know.

Thanks,

"759467","Meeting with State Dept. re Dabhol","Jim

I met yesterday with  Alan Larson's staff at State to bring them up to date on where we are and urge further efforts by State Dept to get the Prime Minkister's office to engage in meaningful negotiations on Dabhol.  State at this point remains fully sympathetic to the position we are in and recognizes that a closer U.S.-Indian relationship long term must be built on a sound commercial relationship, which cannot exist so long as Dabhol remains unaddressed and unresolved.  To that end their word is that the commercial dialogue continues and continues as a priority.  Larson, Undersecretary of State for Economic and Business Affairs, has been appointed USG Coordinator of the bilateral commercial relationship and a trip planned in November to go to India remains on at the behest of the Ambassador.   This could certainly change with the Afghan situation but this is the situation as of now.

The Ambassador is a critical player for us in terms of his daily interaction with Mishra and other senior Indian govt. officals.  We need to keep him up to speed and view him as a critical resource to pressure the PMO.  Particularly at this juncture, when India is working hard to make sure they are perceived by the USG to be at least as supportive as Pakistan to the US, a word from the Ambassador to the PM to get Dabhol off the table would be jolting. I would encourage Wade to try to meet with him and send the message that he has to step up the pressure to get the Indian side to seriously negotiate.  thanks John","2","2","1","1","3","2","2","3","3","3"
"743370","Pennsylvania $147,000 EES Assessment","EES was recently assessed $147,000 by the Pennsylvania PUC as a method of recovering their costs.  Enron's local PA attorney, Kevin Moody of Wolf, Block, Schorr and Solis-Cohen LLP, notified us that he has taken the lead for a group of natural gas suppliers to challenge the assessments and inquired if Enron wanted to be a part of the group.  The group includes IOGA (an association of oil & gas suppliers in PA), TXU, Hess, New Power, and 4 others.  Moody successfully got a postponement of the payments until Oct 16.  EES is included in the postponement at this time.  The options are to litigate the assessment (Moody feels we are on solid ground to prevail) or to negotiate a settlement with the PUC where we agree to some assessment to be determined.  Litigating the assessment could cost about $50K - $60K (in addition to the $25K to date) whereas settling would obviously be less expensive initially but would provide an assessment for each year going forward.  Moody id meeting with the PA PUC this Friday to determine what would be the best way to proceed (he is hoping to convince them that the statute is quite clear that they cannot make the assessment and that they withdraw it).  We will have a better grasp of the situation and clearer path for the direction we should pursue after that meeting.  I will keep you informed.","2","2","1","1","3","1","2","2","1","1"
"1312911","NS50","Hi Steve, yes I still have the bike for sale, I just decided to sell it last friday (11/23).  I hate to part with it, but I'm trying to raise capital to fund a business venture.  I don't have any pictures of it, but I can borrow my girlfriends digital camera and get you some; however, I won't see her until this friday (11/30), and we are heading out of town until 12/4.  I'll try to see if I can do anything before then, but I can't say for sure, as I don't own a computer or any computer equipment.  I only have computer access at my job.  In reference to shipping cost to Texas, shipping company's usually charge by size, weight, and distance travelled.  The bike doesn't weigh that much, but you'd probably have to check with a truck line to verify a freight prices.  In regard to the title, I do have the title, but

it's still in the person's name that I purchased the bike from.  He had it licensed, with tags on it, and rode it on the street.  I bought it just as a pit/play bike.  I take it to local motorcycle races on a trailer as a pit bike and ride it around my neighborhood, so I never licensed it to keep from paying sales tax.  If it becomes an issue, I can retitle it in my name. The unit has somewhere around 980 miles on it, and it has the optional headlight fairing and engine/radiator shroud/cowl.  The only thing that I did to it when I bought it was change all the fluids, lube, check everything over and adjust things as needed.  Let me know if you have any further questions or need more info.

Thx.

Several weeks ago Eric Moon also resigned.  He too was slated for NetCo Structuring.  At this point Berney is the only remaining individual in NetCo Structuring.  I suggest that we identify individuals that might be considered for replacements.  These individuals are likely to currently be in EstateCo. As EstateCo has not yet announced any retention program I am concerned that possible replacements may elect to leave EstateCo before we have a chance to discuss NetCo positions.

"730404","Summary of WSPP Contracting Meeting","My typing is so poor and slow or else a book would surely follow.  Upon Clyde's return we shall revisit the thorny WSPP meeting in Colorado in the modern way, by phone for lack of my speed and agility.  (CY - I think we were starting to recap the absurdity when Jeff Skilling suddenly resigned).  But in the meanwhile a preview.

The EEI creep was evident when Mike Small after himself, personally,  taking credit for drafting Enron's market disruption language (he said it was very time consuming to draft) proceeded to be challenged by all the EEI members who the day before had sat around the table for 2 productive hours challenging certain concepts that Enron originally proposed (as a result we will be modifying our language soon since some good issues were raised).  After hearing the new issues Mike threw up his arms and asked that we propose new language.  Afterwards, I spoke with Mike, sorry Clyde, and proposed to meet with him to discuss the possibility of bringing the groups together, using the absurdity of the market disruption language discussion as good evidence of what we could achieve together.  He said theoretically that might be able to happen but he never saw it happening.  I asked why.  He said too painful.  What pain.  He said Shari Stack.  I said one bad day in Newport.  He stopped talking.  He did ask if we wouldn't sit down with him and tell him line by line why we don't like the WSPP. , I think this meager offer is something we can't miss so ....  Maybe, at this meeting, Clyde and others can begin the writing of a world of one, a world where Clyde can make yet another name for himself.","1","1","1","1","1","1","2","2","1","1"
"70666","Organizational Announcement","It is with regret that I have to announce that Jeff Skilling is leaving Enron.  Today, the Board of Directors accepted his resignation as President and CEO of Enron.  Jeff is resigning for personal reasons and his decision is voluntary.  I regret his decision, but I accept and understand it.  I have worked closely with Jeff for more than 15 years, including 11 here at Enron, and have had few, if any, professional relationships that I value more.  I am pleased to say that he has agreed to enter into a consulting arrangement with the company to advise me and the Board of Directors.

Now it's time to look forward.

With Jeff leaving, the Board has asked me to resume the responsibilities of President and CEO in addition to my role as Chairman of the Board.  I have agreed.  I want to assure you that I have never felt better about the prospects for the company.  All of you know that our stock price has suffered substantially over the last few months.  One of my top priorities will be to restore a significant amount of the stock value we have lost as soon as possible.  Our performance has never been stronger; our business model has never been more robust; our growth has never been more certain; and most importantly, we have never had a better nor deeper pool of talent throughout the company.  We have the finest organization in American business today.  Together, we will make Enron the world's leading company.

On Thursday at 10:00 a.m. Houston time, we will hold an all employee meeting at the Hyatt.  We will broadcast the meeting to our employees around the world where technically available, and I look forward to seeing many of you there.","3","3","3","3","3","2","1","2","3","2"
"1248894","Needles Pressure Requirement","I've got a copy of the SoCal contract for Needles.  The exact wording for the pressure requirement is:

SECTION 5. PRESSURE.

Seller shall tender gas to Buyer, at the delivery point on the California/Arizona border near Needles, California, at a pressure of not less than 750 PSIG, and not more than 1000 psiq, with an anticipated nominal operating pressure of approximately 800 psig, unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties. For purposes of this Service Agreement, pressure at the delivery point shall be calculated from actual readings at Seller's Needles measurement facility utilising generally accepted engineering formulas designed to calculate a pressure drop over a given distance of pipeline, gravity, temperature, and flow rate and other variables as may be reasonably necessary to make such computation, and may be confirmed by calculations at Buyer's North Needles Compressor station.

It is my interpretation that our pressure requirement occurs exactly at the California/Arizona state line and we can use modeling methods to determine the required outlet pressure at the Needles station required to achieve 800 psig at the state line.","3","3","2","3","2","1","2","2","3","2"
"1105561","EOL","Thanks for your note.  Just so you have the whole picture -- our analysis from a US law perspective is that there is a tension between wanting the transactions on the system to be enforceable and wanting out of the mistake trades.  The offline unwind is by far the best approach when the mistake is not blatant since it assumes the binding nature of the original trade.  We have been handling these by using a written termination rather than a reverse trade.  This is universally the approach we have taken when our traders have agreed to let a customer out of a trade the customer claims was done by mistake on their part.  This happens often enough that we have given the confirm desk a termination agreement form to use as needed (Tana can get you a copy if you want it).  But when the counterparty refuses to let us out of a trade that is a mistake on our part, our only hope is that the mistake is so blatant that we can claim mutual mistake.  Under US law when there is mutual mistake the contract is actually never formed.  In that case, the original trade is not enforceable and there is nothing to unwind.  One alternative we have used is to simply remove the transaction from the customer's ""completed transactions"" section as if it had never happened.  As far as I know, we have only had to do this once or twice.","3","2","3","3","1","2","3","1","3","2"

"764769","Columbia Gulf order on negotiated rates","I think we ought to discuss the Order with Columbia Gulf.  Its possible we are ok.  The problem FERC seems to have is that under the negotiated contract it is impossible for anyone but Columbia and the Shipper to know what the rate is at the time of the transaction.  Columbia's deal contains a default rate (based on index differentials) applicable if the parties are unable to agree on a basis price used to determine the ""Negotiated Daily Reservation Charge"".   To avoid the application of the default rate, the ""Negotiated Daily Reservation Charge"" requires Columbia and the shipper to negotiate, and agree,  to a basis number on a daily basis.  The parties did not specify particular index's for the purpose of calculating basis.  Thus, under Columbia's deal only the default rate can be determined at the time of the transaction.  In contrast, Transwestern's deals appear to be similar to Columbia's default rate; i.e., a rate based upon index's where the index's are agreed upon and stated upfront.  Thanks.

"56419","Replacement Cost Values","The 2001 annual allocated premium for these assets for property insurance is $670,000 based upon ENA's 2001 reported value of approximately $470,000,000.  The pro-rata credit for 7 months, assuming a 5-31-01 sale date, would be $390,833.

Underwriters require an update of values and exposures annually at renewal. Gathering these values within Enron normally requires 30 to 45 days.  We use these same values in the allocation system. Unless the value change is significant, the actual cost of insurance to the outside insurers will not change  Once you complete your entire study of replacement cost values, we can discuss whether approaching underwriters is warranted.

If we internally adjust your allocation mid-year, we must move the premium that we take away from you to the other participants in the program.  As you know, the remainder of Enron did not stand still while you sold Bammel.  We have not tried this before, however, I suspect if approached with the additional premium as a result reducing ENA's allocation, all the other operating entities would want to re-submit their revised  values as well and we would find ourselves in a constant state of adjustment.  In view of the time required, this is neither practical nor cost effective for Enron.  In view of the relatively small numbers, I doubt that Corp. would entertain this proposition either, however, we can approach them if you wish.","3","3","1","3","2","2","2","3","2","2"

The Chinese Wall policy serves to reduce the risk of insider trading liability by keeping material non-public information ""walled off"" from our equity trading personnel.  The Resource Group acts as a sort of ""filter"" so that certain information may pass through the ""wall"", under appropriate controls.  It is critical that we enforce proper compliance with the Chinese Wall policy.  Without this policy, Enron would not be able to engage in equity trading activities.

Early next year, the ENA Legal Department will conduct training sessions on Chinese Wall policies and procedures for our equity traders, Resource Group members, and other appropriate employees.

"84099","Montana Power Company (MPC) Energy Imbalance","Bill; Mike Cashell (MPC's Transmission Mgr.) just phoned me concerned, because MPC's Real-Time group requested EPMI purchase energy for them under our existing Energy Imbalance structure, and was notified by our Real-Time group that due to the newly implemented FERC price cap, we were have difficulty securing any resources.  Just to clarify things, we are settling MPC's Choice customers Energy Imbalance position, and PP&L Montana has the right to any length resulting from MPC's ""domestic"" load Energy Imbalance.  In other words MPC is settling two separate Energy Imbalance accounts, so during the hour they may be turning energy back to PP&L Montana, while at the same time finding themselves short for the Choice loads.  During the recent bullish pricing conditions, Choice customer were leaving themselves long, as of late, MPC is experiencing the Choice customers doing the opposite, positioning themselves short.  The net result is that MPC will most likely be expecting us to fill a short position from this point on, so I'd really like to see what we can do to honor their requests, mindful of the favorable position we've enjoyed over the last several months.

"1248919","Citizens Flagstaff Interconnect","Gale, here is the information that I have available about the subject interconnect.  The actual project is to install an additional tap and measuring facilities at the end of the lateral for peak deliveries of 12-15 MMcfd to ENA for power generating.  The problem is that the lateral capacity is about 25-27 MMcfd based upon turbine meter capacity for the Citizens Flagstaff point, but Citizens has about 25 MMcfd scheduled at their three points on the west end.  Their contract allows for them to take full obligations at either point (Kevin is checking on this); however, I don't believe that their flow regulation at the Flagstaff point (two-2"" regulators) can do more than 15 MMcfd (my intuitive guess, needs to be checked or verified).  Pressure - TW may be between 725-775 psig at peak TW mainline flows to Ca., Citizens pressure is reported to be around 365 psig downstream of control valves.

The greatest daily volume (MN 9213) since Jan 2000 was 11942 Mcf on Jan. 18, 2001 (as can be seen in the attached Excel worksheet extracted from MIPS meas. data).  The flow graph on Jan 18, 2001 also obtained from MIPS is shown below:

Planning Question: if Citizens meter capacity is say 15 MMcfd at some pressure, can we subscribe the remaining lateral capacity to ENA and still maintain pressure and volume obligations to either Citizens or ENA?  What would new pressure conditions look like flowing 30 MMcfd through the lateral?","2","2","1","1","3","2","1","2","2","2"

"1353855","Comments of Wolak","Wolak makes some good points.  In ERCOT, Enron is in support of nodal pricing.  I would not go so far as to say we are pushing for PJM's implementation, however, but for a market with nodal prices (and unilateral bids - aka unbalanced schedules, congestion reflect by price differentials, etc).  I was unaware PJM had such great power to alter bids.  This is something we don't want, and something for which I am not aware we have advocated.  Perhaps in Enron's promotion of locational prices, it has been retold as PJM-style locational prices.  Given that PJM is the most commonly cited example of locational prices, it does not surprise me to have the sloppiness in discussions that could lead to the rumors.

I mean, I'm all for prudence when it comes to the physical side of relationships, but after a month of constant contact and interaction I would have to question the fact I didn't feel compelled to completely jump the guy.  That's not to say I would, but I'd still have to question the lack of desire to do so.  I just don't get the impression that she is that attracted to him.  Seems more like ""good buddy"" to me.  I think she misses the Matt's, Alan's, Thatcher's, etc. that she got that from in the past.

On the plus sides, he is a very happy person who loves to smile and is pleasant to be around.  I just get squeamish watching people cuddle so much.  I'm having flashbacks to sharing a room with Jen when Craigers was in the picture.  It's not a pleasant memory, trust me.
