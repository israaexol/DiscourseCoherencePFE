"40fxk9sDmyhh7S6V6Uuimg","Tacos Sahuaro","Tough little place to find if you haven't been there before.  Little odd with no menu except what is written on the walls so it's a little hard to make a decision on what you want when they ask you at the counter for your order.

On this visit I had the carne asada burrito and my lunch companion had the Carnitas. My lunch companion really enjoyed her dish.  However, the Carne Asada just wasn't very good. The Carne Asada was very small pieces of overcooked beef that lacked flavor and seasoning.  The burrito was a disappointment.

Overall, the service was good and the food just fair..","2","2","1","1","3","2","1","2","3","2"
"zmFn_KhpZPFsvz6Zp9_ogw","GRAZ Kitchen Fresh","I love this place. Like seriously crave their food when I go a week without it. I believe I've ordered the ""Fly me to the Moon"" breakfast sandwich about 10 times already. I take it with turkey and no mayo. It makes me happy. It tastes glorious.

I was sick a couple of days ago and their ""Orange Affair"" smoothie made me feel so much better.

I've come here for lunch several times too. Do yourself a favor and eat the Mac and cheese. The owner is a delight. If you're ever indecisive like I am he will recommend the best stuff. He knows me by face and somehow remembers what I always like!

The owner came out and asked how things was and we asked why he didn't have chicken and be straight up said he never would. You'd think he'd be more open to listening to his customers about what they want...after all, it's the customers who keep him in business. There was a lot of fat on the meat and the burritos were filled with ""mush"" rather than shredded beef. The mango salsa was good and the bean quesadilla was good too.","2","1","2","1","1","2","2","2","1","1"
"bc0dLKd-9LYrRK9GmmWmXg","Redfin Blues","This restaurant is a waterfront spot that serves primarily seafood. I'm not going to lie, I was really excited to try this place but was let down. The food is a little below average and the service was alright. The scenery of the water front was obviously something you can't beat and it was comfortable for the time being.

We ordered the crab cake and nachos for an appetizer and the crispy shrimp, fish tacos, and chicken sandwich for entrees. In the appetizers, the nachos were similar to what you could get at a sporting event and the crab cake was priced high but was not good and actually had a few shells in it that I tasted. What we also found unattractive was the pre-packaged sauces that they put on the plate in plastic containers. Makes us wonder the date and freshness of the ingredients. The entrees were alright but as I said, nothing special.

I most likely won't go back, and probably wouldn't recommend to others.","3","3","2","3","3","2","2","3","2","3"

"OXOVo3ZY6XE_k08gha2nXA","Babystacks Cafe","I remember when there was only one Babystacks Cafe, the original location near me at Buffalo and Smoke Ranch.  Back when it opened in 2011, there were long waits on the weekends for the renowned red velvet pancakes that were served up.  People came from near and far to eat there and I became a regular customer, too.  Since then, Babystacks has opened up other locations and Henderson finally got its own in the summer of 2014.

I've been to this location a few times now and I really can't see the difference in taste or service; that's a good thing.  I have friends who live in Henderson who never went to Babystacks because it was just too far from them.  When I get together with those Henderson pals, we at least have the option to come here for some of our favorites that Babystacks is known for, including:  the red velvet pancakes as well as the Cinnabun (my favorite); Rick's Adobo Fried Rice; Portuguese Sausage and Eggs; Loco Moco.  There is still a wait on the weekends in the mornings, so be prepared; you may get hangry in the process.","3","3","3","3","2","2","2","2","1","1"
"-I1Arja8KXGbZvwH3JQykw","Havana Grill","I spent the money so you don't have to, here is what transpired about the food. Ordered from Bite Squad and it took Havana Grill about 55 mins to fix things up, I had high hopes for this meal but it was horrid. The Cuban sandwich was fair at best , I think I have tasted better at Subway and that's no lie, nothing special about it at all, lacked flavor and it was bland, next was the Pan Con pollo la plancha, it says they marinate it , outright lie there, it wasn't marinated in anything at all, it was dry, flavorless, utterly disgusting and I could only stomach 1.5 bites of it and that was it, absolutely disgusting.   The black beans and rice served with bacon and spices was ok, nothing great about it but at least it had some flavor, the fries the sandwiches were served with were fair, once again nothing special there and there wasn't much of them served. The chips and salsa was a joke, the chips were ok much like any other Latino place but the green salsa was so bland, zero flavor, no heat.

Overall it was a waste of time and money, if a place can't even make a Cubana sandwich correctly and with some flavor there is a problem. This place needs work, heavy work in the kitchen, the food was disgusting for the most part. Save your money and go elsewhere.","3","1","2","2","2","3","2","3","2","3"

It is a bit pricey but a perfect summer treat and I cannot think of anywhere else you can get gelato of this quality! Their pistachio flavour is rich in flavour, smooth and creamy, exactly what I'd image pistachio heaven to taste like. I remembered last summer, they had a yellow fig gelato that was seasonal, and it was delicious and refreshing. I am definitely looking forward to their seasonal flavours this summer!","2","2","3","3","3","2","3","3","2","3"
"ApzqwFxKU5rkyu9HFjv5oA","Naomi","This place has the best muffins in town! I am addicted to muffins from Timmoy's n Second cup(believe from same supplier), and I love pastries. I just happened to walk to Naomi a while ago to grab a treat on the way to work in the mor, they happened to have the muffins tasted like nothing else. And I have been going there since.

The muffins are HUGE, and only $1.25 each no tax. I have tried every kind they had on display. They have chocolate chips, apple cinnamon, blueberry, poppy seeds lemon, and sometimes orange(yes tastes like orange--has flavor of orange pop, but i believe they used orange juice). Their muffins are soft and wrapped up sealed nicely, so u wont be expecting those hard shelled muffins from Tim Horton's. I think those muffins they make taste more like freshly made cake. I tried to ask for recipe they said its secret(hah no brainer).

I have seen their menu, they have pretty good stuff. I'd love to try some time. The best thing about this place is the family run restaurant, the wife n husband are sooooooooooooooooooooooooooo NICE. U know they just truely nice ppl. The moment u walk in, they greet you, and they can't thank you enough for buying small things like muffins n bits. And they make sure both tell  you good bye n have nice day etc. U feel warmth.

Last Saturday my friend was driving by, I tried to go to buy couple of muffins, but the place was closed. They only open till 2pm on Saturdays, and I suspect they even open on Sundays.","2","2","1","1","3","2","2","3","2","3"

The only thing I would mention was that towards the end, we couldn't get our bill. We were ready to pay and get going but because it was super busy, it took a while to get our bill.

"PmU1Ob2xGBzk5OWwm4bwKw","Fusia Dog","Do you suffer from mild allergies that keep you stuffed up? Maybe you have a head cold and are looking for relief? I have a cure for you. Behold the Fusia Dog. The amount of wasabi mayo they slather onto this tube-o-meat is sure to clear any sinus infarction.

These guys are a perfect example of a business that would highly benefit form a reform in the city's food vendor laws. Their location is super small. Not really large enough to have seating, but they squish in a few stools. They would be perfectly suited to a food truck. It's a small menu of 8 or so different dogs, home made chips, and some salads. While I wouldn't say they have a bad location, I'm guessing that a big part of the reason it costs almost $10 for a Fusia Dog and a pop is the overhead of renting their small space in the Entertainment district.

I really want to be a regular here. Their food is great but unfortunately the price will not keep me coming back often enough.

"Wkrvjvo1_l1PiKMOLieiBw","Ice Monster Cafe","I didn't have particularly high hopes for Ice Monster, so it was with low expectations that I walked in on a warm Saturday evening.

The shop is very cute, sleek and clean. Oddly located in the back of a strip mall, hidden away from the street by a popular chain dessert shop, which probably explains why the shop was so empty on a Saturday evening.

My friend and I ordered the pineapple lychee snow ice as well as a mango sensation snow ice to share. The desserts were gorgeous and well-presented in a martini glass. Unfortunately, looks were indeed deceiving. Pretty, but the flavors were lacking for both of the dishes. I preferred the pineapple lychee to the mango but they both had an unappealing artificial flavor I didn't care for. Neither my friend nor I felt the need to finish either dish.

I'd be interested to try their other menu items, but I don't see myself making any special effort to return based on my first visit.","3","3","3","3","3","3","2","3","3","3"

After searching for a commuter bike for some time, the owner of another local bike shop recommended that I give State a try. Upon arriving at their warehouse/office location, I was immediately given a thorough explanation of my options and walked through the process a State Bicycle Co bike goes through before it gets to it's new home. Not only did I end up ordering a bike, but because I wa picking it up instead of having it shipped they gave me a discount! They were also willing to switch out the tire color for me, free of charge.

"MCCbEtg58ze8VL-EITFu4g","Itsy Bitsy","Great spot! I had the miso broth with thick noodles, and it was better than any ramen I'd had in my hometown of Seattle (Samurai, Aloha, Kukai, etc.) Space is cute, service was fantastic, and I don't know what they do to their egg on top of the ramen -- it's usually a throwaway for me, ok at best, but here it was the most delicious egg I'd ever had! I also had their mule made with Japanese whiskey, and it was phenomenal. Their whiskey and ramen combo for $20 is a great deal, too!

My only gripe -- their whiskey menu is small. I mean, if you're billing yourself as a whiskey place, you should probably have more than around 20 whiskeys. They had maybe 5 or 6 Japanese whiskeys on the menu, which is fantastic (however they were out of 2, including Yamazaki), an Irish whiskey or two, a Scotch or two, and the rest American whiskeys, if I recall correctly. I was pretty surprised by the lack of selection.","2","2","2","2","1","2","3","2","1","1"
"s59B3zmgo5aZDhYqOBMsNg","Flamingo Las Vegas Hotel & Casino","WORST Vegas hotel EVER! Room had an iPod-capable system, but did not have enough connectors for every room, so no personal music. Radio was broken and they did not replace it, so no music at all. Did not even have an alarm clock radio in room. TV reception was broken where half of the tv would freeze on a commercial during the show. Air conditioning blew up, leaving our entire room (beds and bags) covered in dust chunks. Maid service NEVER showed up, even after two complaints!

Managers are awful. Talked to one manager who said all he could do was give us room service in our dust-filled room that had still yet to be cleaned, even the next day! The second manager was just as useless. I called front desk to talk to him again and they put me on hold for 20 minutes, then sad he would call me back. Never got the call.

You know the hotel is absolutely horrible when the people that work there laugh about how many complaints they get and say that the hotel (that employs them) sucks.

Another waiter asked me ""What's wrong?"" and I told him we wanted to pay and get out of there. He took the check, apologized for the wait and finally came back with change.

We had sandwich and soup combos and both were delicious.  The bread was fresh and tasty.  We were pleasantly surprised and then grabbed some treats to go.

"exy99i_b8uECj6_mh6Oz7g","Boxcar Social","This is not your average coffee shop. It has the best of the best of both worlds: coffee and alcohol. They have wine, but I'm not much of a wine drinker. However, I can assure you that they have a very good collection of single malt scotches and the baristas know their stuff well.

I've been here twice, my first time just to check out the place and ask about how busy it gets during the weekend. One guy told me I could make reservations via email, which I did. I would have given them 4 stars after they gave me conflicting information, saying that they don't do reservations on the weekend, but they redeemed themselves when the owner of the place figured out who I was and personally apologized for the mix up. That was totally unexpected and it really impressed me.

The atmosphere is very relaxed. It's basically a house turned into a coffee shop. The second floor has more seating. They don't allow alcohol up there, but it's more airy and bright if you want to find a cozy place to read and get caffeinated. Lots of stairs. Definitely not wheelchair friendly.","2","2","3","3","3","3","3","2","2","3"

It was disappointing especially considering the great reviews other people posted. We ordered edamame to start, and they brought us a very small bowl with not nearly enough for 4 of us to have a fair share. The rolls were stuffed full of crab mix and had very thin slices of the desired topping. It was me and hubby and 2 kids, and with 2 beers the tab came to $82. I'd be fine with that in a nice restaurant but in a hole in the wall neighborhood restaurant with mediocre food it was definitely over priced.","2","3","3","3","2","2","2","3","2","2"
"54YD32GLga7JAdjs3Igpew","Mbrgr","I attended a soft opening of this spacious second floor King West newcomer. This is not a newcomer to burgers... I've been a big fan of the Montreal location since it opened a couple years ago. To customize your AAA, organic or kobe burger there are a variety of mouthwatering toppings that range from smoked bacon to shaved truffles (prices range too). The location includes fully stocked bar with a variety of wines though sadly they've not brought the Quebec microbrews with them.

The sesame buns are fresh and just large enough to allow for several add-on toppings. I chose buffalo mozzarella, bacon, caramelized onion, horseradish mayo and of course a fried egg (I shied away from the Michigan sauce - aka chili - on this visit). Of course it was tasty, the burger alone tastes great with the right balance of saltiness and seasoning. Famous Moishe's coleslaw is a nice side along with a basket of sweet potato fries.

Oh and there are various other non-burger items on the menu - don't let the name fool you. I have never ordered anything else here but the poutine looked great and was certified as excellent by a young girl sitting at the table behind me. Desserts also look very tempting but my burger and sides were filling enough.  Pulled pork sandwiches, chicken, tuna and even mac and cheese are vegan options (to me a vegan is anyone who doesn't eat beef).

With several Montreal-based team members relocated to Toronto I think Mbrgr should see a successful opening this month.","2","3","3","3","2","3","3","3","3","3"

To top it off, my wife and I had a date tonight and wanted to give hem one more chance. We talk in at about 7:50pm and are told they are no longer taking walk ins all night. There was nooone waiting and open tables available. So my conclusion is that they will not earn another $1 from me","2","3","2","3","2","3","3","2","2","3"

I have never been to a grocery store where you have to go outside to get a cart and then push it through a gate and walk through a little turn-style type thing to get into the grocery store. Weird. I guess it is to prevent the homeless from stealing the carts, I don't know.

Also, what grocery store runs out of butter? My sister and I went here on a Monday night to get stuff for our hotel rooms. Their produce wasn't the best, in fact all of the cucumbers were very soft and on the verge of going bad. The lettuce was browning and the fruit looked like it was all on its last leg. Anyway, we needed to get some butter as my sister's husband likes bagels with butter in the morning. Well, I guess the section where the butter is kept broke down and they had to take all of it off the shelves. Like I said, ghetto! I guess they didn't have any in the back either.

When we went to check out they had 1 lane open with a line about 10 people deep. The worst thing of it all is that the manager was just standing there fanning herself instead of opening up a register and helping the customers. It was a very frustrating experience. Next time I'll go to a different grocery store.","1","3","3","3","3","1","1","1","2","1"

We just found out there was macaroni salad option for a side by reading the reviews, would have liked to try that.

With ample parking out front, this small restaurant has seating enough for approximately 60 people.  I've been three times and there has been no waits and plenty of seating.  The decor is a clean and spare with the dark hardwood look that is very popular among new Asian restaurants these days.

Order the Beef Noodle Soup for well less than $10 for lunch or dinner.  The large bowl comes with hot beef broth, thick noodles, Chinese veggies (like small bokchoy) and lots of chunky beef.  Although the beef is bit dry and stringy (a common characteristic for this type of dish), the broth has a wonderfully meaty taste and the noodles are fantastic.

It's one of my go-to spots for an after-work pint or a post-movie bite.

The other night, my (much) better half and I had a burger craving, so off we went to the Q&B. The burger was one thing I'd never tried, and it certainly sounds good -- hand-chopped top sirloin, with bacon and stilton, grilled to your specifications.  And... it was OK. Not outstanding. The medium-rare burger was more like medium, and the medium was definitely cooked medium-well. The chopped steak gives the burger nice texture, but it was missing the juiciness and deep flavour of a really great piece of grilled ground beef. The fries, also clearly hand-cut, could have been smaller and fried a bit longer. And the homemade curry ketchup? Uh-uh, pass the Heinz. We asked for mayo, and got a tiny bowl of indifferent white glop for 99¢. In a place that makes everything in house, it just seemed incongruous -- but I guess mayo on fries is Just Not English.

The McAuslan cream ale and the $2 scoops of homemade ice cream -- whisky and gingerbread, strawberry pepper, stilton, etc. - made up for the OK burger.

The kennels are meticulously clean and the dogs are very well card for. There is always a staff member with the different play groups which are separated by size and temperament.  The groups are then rotated so the dogs don't always play with the same ones. They have a play pool for them also!  The prices are on par with other facilities.  My dog is a puppy and they were very patient with nervous mom phone calls the first few times, now the puppy runs to the door when I drop her off!

They offer some good beer on tap, particularly a Scottish one. Our friends recommended the burgers, so I ordered the peppercorn burger with a fried egg on it. I have never had a burger with an egg on it... turned out to be a great idea! The burger was cooked perfectly to what I wanted and the service was good.

Side note: this is a seahawks bar! More brownie points. Haha.

Really laid back bar to come for a good burger and beer. If you aren't a fan of the loud music, there is another room that tones it down a bit and let's you talk to your party without yelling. Great find!","3","2","3","3","2","2","3","1","2","2"

My kids got the cheese enchilada and bean & cheese burrito; they ate it so fast I barley got a picture. My husband & I ordered the Monterey... SOOOO good. Only thing I didn't like was the chicken taco, might switch that for a beef one next time. But the chile rellenos was by far the best part of my dish!!

I agree the owner, Z, is very knowledgeable, but when you see two tables occupied in a restaurant on Friday night and a menu 4 legal pages long...that says GO FOR THE DOOR!  That's fine if you are Denny's or a franchise, but this place presents itself as a locally owned fresh food establishment....everything we ordered tasted processed or frozen!  My husband and I ordered the calamari and the crab puffs...the calamari was tough and tasted processed and the crab puffs had no crab...just sour cream and were soggy!  Our entrees were served as soup with the protein not even remotely tasting like chicken and pork, and vegetables that I could not identify all mixed into a lack luster broth with cold rice on the side!

Probably will next time. I had to work my girls up to riding the big coasters and sadly we didn't ride the 2 big ones fury and intimidator due to inclement weather. It started thundering and lightning after 7pm. It would have been so cool to ride those rides at night!

We got the refillable drink thing and only ate twice through the day and shared an entree. Too busy having fun! Bathrooms were clean and we never had to wait in line. Employees were friendly too.

I want them right now as I am typing this. I had a bubbly champagne drink, can't recall the name but it tasted really good.

The staff is amazing, the people that hang out there are amazing and the coffee is out of this world. They serve coffee, cold drinks, baked goods,pre-made salads and sandwiches and all of it is good. My personal favorite are their toffee chocolate chip cookies and tablerone cookies.

Going back to how amazing the staff is, there's been numerous mornings in which I was super tired from partying the night before and they were were able to put a smile on my face and the coffee would sometime be on the house.

Unfortunately there's not alot of seating in the front but there's a couple of tables in the back. When the weather permits, there's a few seats in the from that you can use to people watch and to just enjoy your coffee and there's also a patio in back and it's a great little sanctuary that allows you to escape the stress of city life.

Like I said, it's the best coffeeshop in the neighborhood and I would highly recommend that you go check it out one day.","3","2","3","3","2","3","3","3","3","3"

So we got here at around 7pm on a Sunday and was expecting someone to greet and sit us. We probably waited for about 5 minutes before someone came out and brought us to our table. There wasn't much customers that time too. Probably 1/4 of the tables or not even were occupied.

So we ordered asparagus wrapped in beef and another one that I totally forgot. The appetizers were okay but something that we may never order again (hopefully we remember not to order it again). I had the sukiyaki for my main entree and my bf had a curry over rice. They were both delicious and flavorful.

Maybe we will go back to Osaka to try their sushi dishes next time.","1","2","3","2","3","3","2","3","2","3"
"bgD3UWo_jdGNccwsQwmNsQ","Von Doughnuts","We visited on a weekday a few months ago around 2:00 PM in the afternoon, and selection was pretty sparse. Regardless, we came out with half a dozen donuts, which we were really eager to try - honestly, look at them, they looked like a million bucks.

However, despite their looks, the donuts actually came off tasting pretty stale. The dough was dry, and wasn't as chewy as I thought they would be. It tasted like a really dry, dressed-up Tim Horton's donut that won the lottery. All the novelty in the world, with the moisture of a California drought. Which, sadly, wasn't what I was expecting. Out of all the donuts in our order, perhaps the Peanut Butter and Jelly donut was the one I most enjoyed - slightly moist, nutty, and flavourful. However, despite flavour, it didn't taste as fresh as I hoped it would be. Dry, with all the moisture and chewiness sucked out of it.

Overall, I love the novelty and the creativity that goes into all the unique flavours, so if I'm ever in the area again, I'll give it another shot - perhaps earlier in the morning when they're fresher. Note that street parking in the area is limited, but if you check out the small side streets around the shop, you may get lucky and score some free parking.","3","2","3","3","2","3","3","2","2","3"

I was concerned slightly as I heard bad things about the rude staff so I tried being extra polite to the staff to not cause any aggro. Security were fine, they just give very short sharp answers but I did have a disagreement with the guy checking tickets as I was uncertain he was legit and he grabbed my ticket but I apologised to the rude guy as I was not letting him ruin my night.

"4UKK8UFUm7BwV5VFbLuM1w","Chop Wok & Talk","Full disclaimer, this review is for the corporate events. I would not choose to do an Asian cooking class as an individual based on my experience, but if you are looking to do a corporate event, I think Chop, Wok and Talk is a pretty good option. It's not authentic Asian which bothers me, as they are a cooking school. I wish they would caveat the menu with ""Asian inspired"" or ""Asian fusion"", since I found quite a few people had never had these dishes before (like Pho or papaya salad)... it's misleading. Nonetheless, authenticity aside, it's a pretty good, fresh way to do a work event.

I've done the corporate team dinners twice now with Dorothy and her staff, at the Sigma conference center location. The dinner took about three hours and we were divided into teams, each tasked with preparing a different component of the meal. Dorothy can be quite authoritarian, but it's probably necessary given the timeline. Everything was well organized and the food, while not completely true to the flavors you would expect, was good. If you keep an open mind (and keep on sipping your wine) you can have a pretty good time!","2","2","3","3","3","1","2","3","3","3"

I've honestly tried almost everything on their menu and I never left disappointed!  This place has true authentic Korean food! The flavors are always there!  The give you such a generous portion of Korean appetizer dishes as well!!! My favorite is the boiled egg! Everyone there is so friendly and prompt so they catered to my every need.  The portions of the dish you order is definitely big so you should expect to have some food left over to take home unless you have a big appetite or company with you...

Well, we are in our 60's so we weren't sure if CT would offend us or make us uncomfortable in any of his show.  He shows a short film at the beginning of his childhood and a lot of crazy stunts he did.  We laughed our heads off.  It was soooo funny!!  CT came out and we started laughing as he went through his trunks pulling out props.  We didn't stop laughing until the show was over.  We were crying from laughing so hard.  What a great guy and so personable with the audience that you felt like you knew him.  We highly recommend seeing Carrot Top at The Luxor!!!  Just do it--you'll love it.

Tasty Asian worked out pretty well. We had walked out of some place called Chop Chop that was a blatant Panda Express rip-off, and this was the next place that we could find.

I had the honey walnut shrimp which turned out to be way more fried than the waitress led me to believe (nice sale, lady!) The hot and sour soup was pretty good, and my buddy's kung-pow chicken/shrimp/beef was spicy enough to clear the sinuses. nice.

Overall the atmosphere was a little dingy, and most of the people that were coming in were getting their food for take-out. It is very close to the rental house though, and they do deliver, so for the next round of classes I'm sure we'll be using them for our late night benders.. er, i mean study sessions.

The associates I encountered seemed as if they were annoyed and didn't care for their jobs. The young man at the register also left a lot to be desired. It were as if he were a robot.

I ordered what I thought was a warm lobster roll and what came out was cold and had coleslaw (not detailed on the menu). When I pushed back the waitress tried to get the chef to explain the recipe to me I told her that I wanted something else. She then came back and asked if I wanted it warmed up. I said no and told her what I wanted to eat.

When it came to pay the bill we asked for split checks and she said she would just take our cards and be back with our receipts. I was not shocked when she ran my card on someone else's bill. When I told the manager about it he seemed very disinterested. Hell, the waitstaff didn't even know about their Cinco De Mayo specials.

Of course my husband had the monster burger and had to order the Chencho fries.

While festivals like Great Vegas  Beer Festival, Brews Best, and Downtown Beer Festival pull premium vendors, breweries, and entertainment----Rockstar Beer Festival prides itself on mediocrity.

It's a overpriced frat party or Vegas Pool Club party. It's more of a party to be ""seen"" rather than drink craft beer at.

While they may pull a few local craft brewers, they really don't strive to pull anything else spectacular. Majority of the beers are your macro micros. The beer vendors in town such as Johnson Brothers, Southern, Nevada Beverage, and Bonanza tend to bring out the bottom of their portfolios. When you go to other festivals in Las Vegas, these vendors bring out beers you haven't heard of nor tasted. When you go to Rockstar Beer Festival (or any of the similar beer tastings the promoter does), you get Shocktop and Blue Moon!!!

The pizza is made from scratch so it usually takes about 45 minutes, but it's well worth the wait. This restaurant is extremely popular so there is usually a wait for a table anyways, and they will let you put your pizza order in early.

In addition to the deep dish pizza, they also have some excellent thin crust pizzas as well, most of them are very unique but excellent. I also really like their Pablo Picasso salad. It is a hearty salad that is topped with chicken, cheese, onions, chips, etc. The full size salad is huge! I can hardly ever finish it. They also have amazing garlic cheese bread. I miss their big ol' ravioli, it used to be my favorite, please bring it back! And please expand to San Diego! There isn't any good pizza here!!

They have a variety of clothing, toiletries, shoes, housewares and even some groceries such as coffee, tea and snacks.

If you've never been to a Burlington, just be prepared to do some searching if you are clothing shopping. It has a similar set-up to a TJ Maxx or Ross where you have to search the racks. They have pretty good clearance deals and I'm usually impressed with their shoe selection. You can usually find some great deals on name-brand things that have been significantly marked down.

The store is always clean and all of the staff that I have interacted with are very friendly and helpful. It's a great place to go if you need to kill some time downtown or work closeby.

But this shouldn't discourage the adventurer. The food is good, and it isn't that hard to stay on a meat free path. The service have room to improve, but I shouldn't venture there..

We finally were seated and took a long time for our waitress to come and ask us for our drink order. Then we did not see her for about another 5 minutes to take our order. It felt like it took about an hour for our food to come. She did not offer us refills nor did she give us napkins or silverware, we had to ask for everything. The waitress never came back to the table to check on us to see if everything was ok. We had to ask another waitress to get our waitress for refills, she didn't come to the table she just brought them and slammed them down and walked off. This place needs to either hire friendlier waitresses or do better training. There were too many teenagers just standing around and talking rather than checking on their customers. We had to complain to the manager to let her know what was going on. Our waitress came to our table and cleared our plates and said we were getting our meal compt and then walked off again. No apologies from her, just attitude. We got the check and only half was taken, never coming back to this place. My poor mother took it personally, like we were not good enough to serve. The food wasn't even that good, very disappointed in this place!","1","3","2","2","3","3","2","1","1","2"

I seriously have never had such tasty perfectly cooked baby back ribs.  We have been there 3 times in two weeks.  The atmosphere is great, the servers are beyond accommodating and nice.  They have a condiment station in the middle of the restaurant so you don't have to wait while your food gets cold.  The french fries are to die for.  No grease and each one is crunchy.  My favorite is the rib and burger platter which is 1/2 slab ribs, 2 sliders, and a salad or fries.  Try it you'll love it!","2","2","3","3","2","2","2","1","2","1"
"ATEw3l3lf2CrhkbXjz5KqA","Tokyo Sushi Buffet","My wife and I are regular visitors to the nearby Tokyo Sushi Buffet. It was the second place we went to on a date and we have continued to eat there for a number of years now. By a happy coincidence, I met the owners before I started going.

This is the best sushi buffet place in Ross Township by far. We particularly enjoy the many sushi offerings but everything, absolutely everything, is carefully prepared and more flavorful than any other place we normally eat at. It's really good food, far better than what it typically on offer elsewhere in this area of Pittsburgh, and we know, because it's not at all a stretch to say we've visited every other restaurant and buffet in the area. Again and again, we keep coming back.

The Liu family have put their heart and soul into this business and it shows. This is one of the very few consistently excellent places in the area to have a great dinner with your loved ones. I can't recommend it highly enough.","2","2","3","3","3","3","3","3","3","3"

The first couple of times we boarded her it was last minute and seemed like a great option but she came home coughing which I attributed to her still being a puppy. Several hundred dollars later after taking her to the vet for antibiotics and steroids she got better. We started using them for the daycare on half price days but every time she would come home with scratches and bites on her. We brought that up and asked them to please watch her closer. Well today I go to pick my dog up and the girl at the desk argues with me about whether or not my dog was there. She asked did I drop her off I say yes then she asked could someone else have picked her up I say no then she looks at me sideways before finally going to the back to check and of course she comes back with my dog. It is scary that she didn't even know which dogs were there and even though it will be less convenient I will be taking her somewhere else where I feel she will be safe.","2","2","2","2","2","3","1","2","1","1"

You can taste the love Mona, who owns the place, and her ""cousin"" put into the food. My boyfriend was grubbin' on the Philly cheesesteak he got, and loved it even more dipped in the homemade tzatziki sauce. I can tell because he wouldn't stop moaning. I'm a huge fan of tzatziki, it's hard to find someone who makes it like I like it, but she's definitely got my taste buds happy. I got the fava beans and pita bread with the tzatziki. She even brought out the fava beans for me to taste to see if It needed any more salt or spice to my liking. Check it out if you're on the north side!

The bathroom was very small. There was a stain of something brownish/reddish on the sheets(gross). I would say the worst was that the ac did not work! It was to hot in there I couldn't sleep.

So we tried Michael Mina's StripSteak. My dining guest said Mina's name like I should know it, I think he has a restaurant in San Francisco too.

First, the Rare Ahi, Nioise Garnish was just simple with simple seasoning that was perfect. I got the Prime Rib rare to check to see if they could do it right, because most place's rare prime rib is just not done slow enough and if not over done it is still just tough. I was very impress. And the Brussels sprouts we ordered was prepared all sliced up like cole slaw, we were both impressed. The lobster was cut in half long ways so it was no work at all to eat lobster. It was marked as market priced on the menu and we both bet to see who came close. I bet $50 and my friend said $60, it came to $74 but we both said it was seasoned well and was worth it, believe it  or not.

So, I'm going to have to find this other restaurant in San Francisco.","3","3","3","3","3","2","3","3","3","3"

My friend had the Dark Side of the Moon blended beer which she liked and the stuffed mushrooms which were also very tasty. Then we also ordered a dish of carnitas fries topped with green chili's, pork and onions and it was awful. The service was just as bad. A waitress with zero personality. Also, the wait was ridiculous for not being very busy. We ordered dessert but after waiting twenty five minutes waiting for it we got the check and left.

"3j48Urx6X5Ak-6S3FPSKjA","Speakeasy","The Speakeasy is a small bar in the Omni William Penn Hotel. It is a really small place, but has a nice ambiance about it. The lounge area is setup for small intimate parties, and the bartenders come out to provide personal service to the tables as well as the bar. The lighting is low and the art is reminiscent of a 20's speakeasy.

I went there with a few colleagues and a client after a day or meetings and dinner. It was a pretty nice spot for a Thursday afternoon. Quiet and personal. Between us we had the Moscow Mules, which come in a regular and citrus version. I had one of each and they were both outstanding. My colleagues had a Gin Rickey and Manhattan, both of which were very good according to those imbibing. This was also one of the few places I have been to that has Absinthe (a favorite of mine) and also has the cold water fountain to go along with it, though they are loathe to use it.

I did have two issues with the place though. One was that the drink menu had mostly complicated drinks that take many steps to complete. The drink orders were very slow to arrive after placing. I was typically ordering my next drink when my current was only 1/2 done. Also, it was very easy to hear everyone else conversation. While there was only a few people there at the time, had it been busier I expect it would have been pretty loud, which does not fit with the ambiance if you ask me. Also, a larger crowd would have slowed down the service even more.","3","3","3","3","3","3","3","2","3","3"

The menu was not explained to us when we got in but it's okay. Most of the employees don't speak English but they are all friendly! The price is kinda high if you are used to going down to Chinatown to eat AYCE. We got two meats and an app but we were still hungry. The portions were not huge. We then had to order more meat. Overall it was a good experience since we love trying new places. They actually cook the meat for you which kinda takes out the fun of Korean BBQ.  Overall for $100 it's an okay place. For half that price you can go down to Chinatown and AYCE, but the experience is what will bring you back to this place. Beautiful, clean, and friendly.","2","3","3","3","3","1","2","2","2","2"

We were only in Vegas for two nights but we liked Lagasse's Stadium so much that we went there both nights.  The seating is so comfy and with all the tv's you won't miss any sporting events.

The food and drinks were also great.  I recommend the Mulligan (a pitcher is a great value) and the Acadian Caprese Salad.  The Mulligan is a rum-based pomegranate cocktail that isn't too strong so you can sip several and not feel like a lush.  The salad took the basic tomato, fresh mozzarella and basil to a HO. NUVA.

Up until renovations were completed, this mall probably wasn't my favourite, just because it felt old and the old food court was somewhat mediocre.  When they announced that the food court was moving, I had my doubts because it looked like it was moving to a smaller area, but after looking at it, I thought it looked and felt great.

There's a lot of variety at the mall between clothing stores, food places and several others that fit a specific need.  So that's there.  Parking is very plentiful as well.  I've never had much of an issue finding a spot except maybe around peak hours during the holidays.  Of course, as long as you aren't those people that need to park within eye distance of the doors.  From my experiences, the employees are generally really nice.  You've got the odd store in there that you won't like but you can usually find another store that has the same type of product.

Great shopping mall so go here if you want one with lots of variety.","1","2","3","2","3","3","2","2","3","3"

Matt is well worth the price of admission. I hope his show takes off like Vinnie Favorito has. Matt deserves a long successful career. A definite ""Must see"" when you get to Vegas. Not a fancy showroom, but small and perfect for a fairly prices night of laughter.

Oh! One last thing - Matt's show is funny for all ages, not just those over 40.

We went early so the restaurant wasn't too packed and the restaurant had $10 parking on weekends. The decor was interesting - asian fusion but old fashioned. It wasn't really to my taste as I thought it felt too cold and eclectic for dimsum.

The food was pretty good, I remember the braised park over lentils and the tiger shrimp being particularly well done. We also had some classic dishes like their rice noodle and steamed dumplings which I thought were good but I had definitely had better. We had a couple other things such as a fusion fried rice and some sweet dishes that weren't very memorable.

Aesthetically speaking, it's a very nice inside with bottles of champagne (believed they're unopened or empty), glasses decorated with clear crystals, full length mirrors, silver decorations, great lighting and it was clean.

My one feedback would be to get foot stools or ottomans for customers who get their hair washed... It'll help not strain our backs in awkward positions while we are bent backwards with our legs stretched out front. This would be a great addition!

Regardless, my experience was great and I'd definitely come again for a blow out. My event was my anniversary dinner while we were in Vegas celebrating. I'm very pleased with how my blow out turned out and my stylist and I chatted it up the whole time. Great chair side manner!

It cost $8.50 for her admission, and it seemed like a good deal to us. We were there for at least an hour and a half. There were several slide/obstacles for her to run through, and she definitely got some good exercise. There was a decently sized area for 3-years-old and younger kids as well (where older kids aren't permitted).  There seemed to be no employees on duty enforcing the rules, so it was nice when some of the parents watched their kids a little bit and made sure they're not bullying, being bullied, or playing in an area where they're not supposed to be.  At one point I realized my niece was playing in the little kids section, she didn't realize it, but I didn't want her to hurt one of those tater tots. Oops!

Tip: Take refillable water bottles and use the water fountain in the back (instead of purchasing water). She definitely needed a ton of water after running around so much.

Hopefully it was a fluke, but out of the 3 stalls in the ladies restroom, two of them were out of order.

Nor was the pretzel and beer cheese, just one of those ""I'll eat it because I'm hungry and it's front of my face."" I see so much potential here though! Like I said, it's in a hot spot and it's really nice inside. A big plus for me was the fact that they had games. It's very rare to find that at a bar in a city and so I ended up spending three hours here playing games! So I guess it could be a good thing it wasn't obnoxiously loud.

We started with the ricotta bruschetta. It was served on a big loaf topped with Paesano, Ricotta, Speck Parmigiano, Mint and olive oil. It was really good, but I wish since we were sharing that it was served in individual pieces. Kind of weird to have bruschetta on one giant piece as it got messy cutting it up.

For lunch, most of us got the express lunch meal. For $8.99 you get a salad or soup, pasta (spaghetti with meatballs, carbonara, Penne vodka or penne with sausage) plus a piece of cheesecake. It was served bento box style and portion sizes were good. I actually got the chopped salmon salad. It was good but the olives and ham made it really salty. Not sure if I would get it again.

I would go back for lunch, especially for the lunch express deal. I wasn't blown away, but service was fast and the food was good. Plus, there aren't many places in Uptown where you can get lunch for less than $9.","3","3","2","3","3","2","3","3","3","3"

The best thing about the brazillian smoothing is it uses natural plant ingredient unlike most relaxers that use strong chemicals that can damage your hair cuticle. Not to mention the whole process only took 2 hours, and it should last for about 4 months or more. The stylist, Lauren, she did a really nice job, she actually took the time to give me a brief consultation before I decided to get the process done. I would recommend Lauren as the girl you go to for Brazillian smoothing. The whole process cost about 250, but the result is great..","1","2","2","1","1","3","3","3","1","2"
"1QAE1djvFPgUnMPGSxSn6w","Ultra Patios","After contacting a few patio cover companies in Las Vegas for free quotes to install one to the back of my house which faces the west and gets the all-day sun, we decided to go with Ultra Patios and could not be more pleased. The owner or manager Tom, was friendly and not a pushy salesman like the rest of the companies we called over. His estimate was exactly what we paid for. The installation went perfect as promised. This purchase was not a luxury item but a necessity as the sun was devastating in our back yard. Overall, a great experience hiring this company which is rare when hiring contractors out here. Would like to thank the owners for also giving me a military discount. Me and my wife thank you very much, and wish you the best of luck with your business. Will be adding photos to my review on the work performed over the weekend in my updated review.","2","2","3","3","2","1","2","1","2","1"
"Iw9KI31ZEYbUNxSaMkmdVw","Gen Korean BBQ House","I visited Nielsens for the first time on a very busy Saturday night. The cashier was very overwhelmed and had to repeat our order 3 times but I didn't really mind considering he's probably had a rough day. However, they don't have any kind of system for distributing the custard, they don't take names or give numbers or anything like that. I didn't even get a recepit so I didn't even know how to ask for my order. Because of this, I watched people who were in line after me get their stuff before me. After 20 minutes of this, I finally said something and they just totally lost my order or I don't know what. Their frozen custard is good but their service on a busy night was greatly disappointing and not to mention it's rather pricy. I probably will still return when it's not so busy but beware when coming in during peak times.","1","1","2","1","1","2","3","2","1","1"
"1Kc_trDSrz6drMOVJ2DP8g","A Traders Turquoise Chief","So I found this spot on a whim, as I was looking to get my busted plastic watch strap. I seriously thought I walked straight into a museum. While the strap he replaced the original with was a piece of schitt, and the prices were really just ok (I felt he slightly overcharged me for a few things), I literally spent hours in here wading through this dudes insane collection of various rings, knives, charms, necklaces, jewelry. It was funny, there also was also customer who I was chatting with while I was getting my repair done and she too had somehow gotten ""lost"" while roaming around this tight little shop.

However as a future reference he seemed open to the idea of haggling and bargaining and I will be back to the store. He mentioned that he can also do minor jewelry repair and design. I feel like this dudes shop would do so much better if he were in a better location because you just don't find many stores like this anymore.","3","2","3","3","1","1","2","3","2","1"

When we arrived at 9:15 and indicated our order the woman at the desk began entering it in as a new order. I explained that our order was already taken down and we were here for pickup at 9:10. I was passed on to another gentleman at the counter, who then passed me his cellphone to speak to someone on the other end. That person told me he forgot the order and if I could wait 20 minutes they would prepare it for us there. No apology, no explanation, nothing.

Two co-workers and I went here for the first time on our lunch and ordered the sushi. We picked off their lunch menu and each got the Two Roll Combo. Both my co-works got a California Roll and Spicy Tuna Roll, I got a California Roll and Spicy Salmon Roll. I had also ordered the Veggie Spring Rolls to start off with... Let me start by saying this place looks very pleasing to the eye, even the food LOOKED good. We actually weren't that happy with the taste and felt it was pretty ""basic"". Well tragedy hit when we got back to the office because we all got sick! Lucky we did not eat it all so it wasn't as bad as we imagined it would have been if we ate it all. The spring rolls were nice and crunchy on the outside but mushy on the inside. It's safe to say we all agreed NOT to go back.","1","2","1","1","1","2","2","1","3","1"
"T9swH7xnizGI1ZAn2_1PGg","Synergy Vapor Labs","This was the first vape shop that we visited & we definitely left with a bad taste in our mouth. Pun intended. The guy was really snotty acting & seemed inconvenienced when we wanted to try liquids. He also gave us questionable advice such as to keep our liquids stored in a dark place with ""absolutely no sunlight- direct or indirect."" This makes sense but when we questioned why he could keep all of his liquids stored in the store with bright sunlight streaming in he couldn't offer an explanation. It just seemed weird to us. This was only 1 example of some of the advice that we later found out to be misleading.

We also noticed when we got home that 2 of the 3 bottles of liquid that we bought were missing at least 1/2-1 mil of liquid. We have sinse purchased about 45 bottles from different places & they have each been as full as you would expect.

Another thing that irritated us was his superior attitude about us not having the same battery that he sells, despite the fact that our equipment is a reputable brand, and more costly than his stuff.  I'm not saying it's better but it's definitely comparable & we were put off at his arrogant attitude. We have taken our equipment in each of the other vape shops that we have visited & none of them gave 2 craps that it wasn't *their* favorite brands.","3","3","2","3","1","2","3","3","2","2"

All 3 times we were very happy with the food. Parsley is counter service where you have the food prepared for you from all the ingrediants behind a glass food bar.  You can have any item custom made the way you like it, which is was we like.  I love a chicken shawarma plate but I only like certain sides on the plate so this works out great.  They are a little stingy on the pita bread and they charge for every little extra you order but with the use of the groupon that is no problem.  We have started to like parsley over Daily Chicken across from UNLV on Marlyland Pky as it is cheaper and really just as good.","3","2","3","3","3","2","2","2","2","2"

My first impression of the menu was that it was very Westernized.  I appreciate all kinds of Asian-inspired cuisine but I think I was just hoping for more authentic Chinese. I ended up ordering the Chinese-style steak and my hubby ordered the Firecracker Shrimp.  They were both good but my steak was little on the tougher side.  His shrimp was cooked perfectly.

I was expecting more after reading the reviews, but to me there was nothing special about it. Coffee served in small mugs, which was Ok only so long as the refills came frequently, and for the most part they did. French toast OK (when I drenched it in syrup), and the bacon was good. Home fries a little disappointing, pretty much square french fries--I should have upgraded with the peppers and onions add-on. Mushroom omelet also OK, but the mushroom pieces were not as big and plentiful as we've seen elsewhere. Absolutely nothing wrong, but no reason for me to return (except maybe to try a hamburger).","1","1","2","1","2","2","2","3","2","2"

I am a single mom and own my own business so selling and listing a home was never going to come at a good time....Corey really stepped up to the plate!

The service was quick, efficient and friendly.  I enjoyed the fact that the kitchen was visible from both the dining and bar area, and from time to time, you get to see fire spark up as they cook the steaks.   I would definitely come back, but I can't honestly say that it's my favorite place to grab a steak, but it really wish I could!  There is one thing that bugs me, which is that the steaks have way too much fat to meat content.  The steaks themselves are cooked perfectly and are seasoned amazingly.  The steaks also come with amazing thin cut fries reminiscent of hickory sticks chips along with your choice of gravy, which is great, but again, but there was just way too much fat to meat ratio for me to give this establishment a perfect score.  For reference, I tried both the ribeye and the New York striploin.  I love the bread they serve, it's fresh, hot, soft and tender.  It's definitely a treat.  I look forward to going back and trying out their burger, which looks amazing, based on the yelp reviewers' photos.  4.5/5","3","2","3","3","1","3","2","2","3","2"

"XM4AiCPsvCP9rLe5uoPVfQ","Pita Jungle","I'm sort of torn on this review because when I went to Pita Jungle a few weeks ago pats of it were really good, and other parts were really bad.

First off I guess I'll start with the bad. I went with my BF around 1:30, the lunch rush seemed basically over, there were a good amount of people in there though. When we walked in it took about 5 minutes for anyone to acknowledge us and to get seated. It looked like the manager was standing around chatting with employees. Another 5+ minutes went by and a girl came and took our drink orders, a different girl brought us our drinks then she said she would get our server. 10 more minutes went by and I was wondering what was taking so long since they weren't very busy and she came over and asked us for our drink order, once she saw we had our drinks she took our food order an that was basically the last we saw of her. Yet another girl brought us our food and no one came over for re-fills or anything which was disappointing. Our ""waitress"" did come back to give us the check and ask how everything was. We didn't tip very much since we had like 5 different girls help us..or something like that.

Now the good! The gyro was amazing, a great portion that I could barely finish. My BF got falafel that was also great. Loved the atmosphere and the ""feel"" of this place. I'll definitely go back and try to see if the service is any better. If the service wasn't so terrible this place would be a solid 4 stars! Worth a try for the yummy food...but still, so unimpressed with the professionalism here..or lack there of.","1","2","1","1","1","3","2","2","3","2"

There was a miscommunication between my work and Sheraton so there was some trouble getting my room straightened out when I arrived yesterday afternoon. The front desk staff couldn't have been more helpful and apologetic for something that wasn't really their fault. Everything was straightened out in the end and I came out of it with a free drink.

The French toast was absolutely delicious, the eggs cooked perfectly (over medium) and bacon was tasty - but limp and not crispy at all. Our food came super fast, along with the food came our check and a partial refill of my coffee that was still 2/3 full. The server never came back after that, and we sat there for at least 20 more minutes. I would've liked at least one refill of my coffee, and I kept thinking she'd come back - but never did. I hate it when they bring your check with your food, how do they know you wouldn't like something else? The guy at the counter we paid the bill to was really friendly, I expected him to ask how everything was - but he didn't. Oh well. The food was good, so I'd like to give them 4 stars, but the service left a lot to be desired. It could have been a fluke, but I'm just not sure I was blown away enough to give them another chance.

This past weekend, I went to Las Vegas and after a show was debating where to go for dinner. It was down to Table 10 or the sushi place across the way, and the gf and I decided to go with the Nola flavor (and shorter wait) of an Emril establishment. It was the right choice.

The atmosphere was nice, very understated in comparison to the casino downstairs or the bright spectacle of some of the other celeb-chef places, and the music was low-key enough so that you could carry on a conversation with your table without yelling. The gf ordered the scallops and I ordered the beef special, and we both split a bottle of wine. The main dishes were good, though I also ordered a side of the truffle mac and cheese which stole the show. While good, we both agreed that we probably would've ordered a few of the more traditional small plates to split and consulted on the bottle of wine before ordering, but those are minor quibbles about what was a very pleasant experience.","3","3","3","3","2","2","3","2","2","2"

I think they have a better understanding than most that ""hey I have not had caffeine yet I am grouchy like a wild animal"".  One thing that sets this Starbucks apart from the rest is that the workers here are actually helpful and knowledgable, offering suggestions and tips when called for.  They also aren't stingy and have given me a free coupon for a free drink when my ordered drink took too long (which I didn't think it did and tried to give it back but they wouldn't take it)  My only complaint is that it's a little small and lacks a sufficient plugs when I want to get my study on.

If you are getting hair dyed you can hang out on their comfy couches with coffee/tea. I have had my hair cut three times here. The first two I was quite pleased with , the last was ok- I only ever get a trim so nothing too drastic was required but somehow it wasn't a great cut.

They do have a student deal and offer services of head massage , manicure/pedicure and other massages. Prices can vary depending on the service- probably the most relaxing hair wash I have ever had, but careful on offers for head massage etc as this will be added to your bill in the end and lead to a possible unpleasant suprise.

With its combination of food, drinks, and fun this place had something for everyone, regardless if you want to hit some balls or not. The technology and idea to create a driving range where it can be more than hitting balls on to a green is quite novel and sorely needed in southern California.

For a place this size you would think that would not be an issue.  Here are the problems we faced:wrong orders served, some orders not served at all, long wait time for service, and they would not split the bill more than 5 ways.  I will give their staff credit for kindness, humour, rushing to fix issues, and apologizing for their mistakes.

The food is mediocre.  I prefer the quality and taste of most of their izakaya competitors.  The only thing I could see that sets them apart is the polar bear beer - Sapporo is served with frozen foam that keeps your beer ice cold longer and comes in 4 different sizes. Go large or go home.

I don don think I will be returning to this izakaya.","2","2","2","2","2","2","3","3","2","3"

Even while sitting in the MD office, it didn't take too long for the doc to see me.  He came and diagnosed me quickly and gave me my prescription and sent me on my way.

The highlights for me were the lamb meatballs, the sumac fries, the chicken jalfrezi and the salmon. Although, all the dishes were perfectly and distinctly seasoned. I find that restaurants serving middle eastern/south Asian cuisine often over-cook their meats, but that was not the case here. The whole menu here is an elevated version of dishes I've experienced before, but with better ingredients and more finesse.

For four years there was never a problem, but now, the exact same model boot, they can't oil them while I wait because of some BS about the uppers and the laces.

Once I suggested that I be allowed to do it myself and this was granted.

I think it is just laziness.  I asked him to just oil the bottom half since I didn't want to leave my boots.  He complied.

If he reads this and gets his act together and gets the job done like years past, I will push this up to 5 stars.","3","2","2","3","3","2","3","3","2","3"

I've always known I was missing out (speaking as a teashop 168 kind of guy) on the full bubble tea experience but this was exactly what I've been saying a bubble tea place should be! The interior is super nice and chic and cozy with an amazing playlist. Customer service is fantastic. The first thing they did was offer us free samples, and naturally I went right for the sample. I got the oolong milk tea that tastes like a cookie with brown sugar on top. I love that you can choose sugar and ice levels and have so many options for toppings (pearls, grass jelly, coconut jelly, red bean etc!) And you don't get charged extra for half sweet (teashop 168!!!! )

Overall the drinks were incredibly yummy, service was fast and very friendly and communicative, and interior was very nice and chic. Our new go-to!","1","3","3","3","1","3","2","2","3","2"
"C8t5pKNfzpdaH8YSFDVEpQ","Seamus McCaffrey's","Well unfortunately today was the last day I will go to Seamus due to their lack of respect and value for their regular costumers.  I have worked on the other side of the block for the last 4 years.  My office has approximately 40 people and frequently groups of us will order food from here. I have also ordered food from here for my work potlucks.

Today I understand is the busiest and probably most profitable day of the year.  The rudeness I experienced from some of the staff (original server was amazing and super nice) over two $10 wristbands was disappointing.  (We were there when it was free. We had to go back to the office and wanted to return a little while later). They would not give us the wristbands without paying $20.   You just lost multiple regular costumers over $20.   I will not suggest Seamus to my co-workers for lunch again.","2","1","2","1","3","2","2","2","1","2"

My husband loved the Spaghetti and Meatballs, and our friendly waitress, Tricia, kindly pointed out that it was two-for-one night on his order, so for just a dollar more, he received a second full order to take home for tomorrow. Woohoo! My order was more complicated: I'm allergic to wheat, so no pasta for me. I ordered the California burger, no bun, and asked if the chef could put chopped garlic on my French fries because I can't eat garlic bread. No problem at all, Tricia told us. And extra veggies with my burger, some ranch dressing on the side? Yes, indeed. Our meals were served hot and quickly, and that's the best beef burger I've had in forever! My fries were perfect! I asked Tricia to please let the chef know how happy I was with my dinner and the extra trouble they went to for me. These folks are the best! They really want you to enjoy your dinner.

The sign outside says ""please see hostess inside for patio seating"" so we step inside... not a soul to be seen besides customers at a few tables. No hostess, no one behind the bar, no server to be found, no manager, no greeting. We stood there at the entrance near the bar and waited for about 5 minutes before realizing that this must be the reason hardly anyone goes there. Besides the food being subpar, customer service seems to be at an all time low. Just before turning away and leaving a CUSTOMER yells out ""you can just seat yourself"" ...ahhh no, thanks though.

I tried this spot on my birthday because I really wanted indian food, but specifically because the website said they had belly dancing entertainment.  Drove all the way there to find out belly dancing only happens Friday and Saturday...bummer!

Ok so food...it was hella spicy and I like spicy food. But my children couldn't eat it. Everyting was one note of spicy so it was hard to enjoy the good flavors. Worse off is you didn't have much to wash it down with since there are no refills on drinks, but thank heavens for the HOT chai table at least.  To top it off I think the prices are wayyy to high as you have to order everything, rice and naan are not included wih the meals!! Every other indian spot I've been to that is standard. Overall the ambience was quaint but I'm sad to say I've had better and didn't have to spend over $60 for tandoori chicken, spinach paneer, samosas, and pesto naan!!!","1","2","2","1","3","2","2","2","3","3"
"XHKpyYQ897Gb1ffQGSXpbA","George and Son's","We stopped here for a late lunch this afternoon. The place was fairly empty so the service was quick. We ordered lunch specials; citrus chicken, chicken chow mien, and curry chicken. Everyone was happy with their meals but it was nothing amazing. The crab wonton was fantastic but no one cared for the spring roll. Lunch for 3 was about $31.00 before tip.

The place was clean but the endless Billy Joel music was a turn off. I'm a fan, but unless I am at a concert I need some variety in my music.

We went back here for dinner last night (3/5/16) and I am glad we did. The food was very good, as was the service. They even brought us out a sample while waiting to order of their Thai chicken. There were 5 of us so we ordered quite a bit of food and everything was good. My orange beef was a bit too sweet and after a couple bites I couldn't eat any more but it was still tasty. The orange chicken was my favorite dish on the table.

The Billy Joel music is still on but it was pretty loud there last night so it wasn't as noticeable.","3","2","2","3","3","3","2","3","1","3"

A friend recommended Ashlee's Printing to me, where she had gone to have her announcements, enclosure cards, and envelopes designed and printed. She loved how everything turned out, so I decided to look into it.

I was a very stressed about how much we needed because we had a very close deadline, but their turnaround time was great. They printed everything beautifully, exactly when I needed it. They worked with me to get everything done for a very affordable price. Ryan and the whole staff there was so accommodating and patient, as I changed my mind on what I wanted a few times. Ryan was very knowledgeable, had creative ideas, and gave great suggestions. He went out of his way to help us in so many ways. Our envelopes are especially so beautiful, I have gotten complements on those alone! Everything was exactly how I wanted it, but turned out looking better than I could have imagined.

I will definitely be going back to Ashlee's Printing because they are great to work with, deliver fantastic product, and have affordable prices. I already have and will continue to recommend Ashlee's Printing to anyone and everyone.","3","2","3","3","3","2","3","3","3","3"
"_zEr2qp8sU3eFFoWfH4mTg","Texas Roadhouse","This place was packed on a Tuesday night and I'm not just talking about consumers. It appears that the restaurant hired half of the people in the surrounding area to work here. You will constantly be dodging employees in different color T-shirts as you try and get to your table, the bathroom or the bar. On this night and probably many others, it was the Texas Madhouse. Parking will also be a future nightmare as this location is right next to the movie theatre.

The baby back ribs were top notch, but the rib eye steak had major issues. Our steak was sent back twice, but the cooks still could not get it well done. It ended up being taken off the bill. The ribs, on the other hand, were so tender that the meat fell off the bone before I could even pick them up. All the side dishes were good, including the loaded baked potato and chili. Of course, free peanuts were everywhere and the manager (green shirts) was nice about the bad steak, but since steaks are what they are know for, not being able to cook one properly is an issue.","1","2","2","1","2","3","3","3","2","3"

Never having been to this restaurant before we we excited to experience the fresh seafood this establishment prepares. Our waiter Chad was excellent in his recommendations for appetizers, Maryland crab soup and pistachio, mandarin salad with goat cheese in a blood orange vinegarette. Very flavorful and would have been satisfied with these as our main entrees. He suggested the Chilean sea bass with macademia crusted topping and the grouper with the artichokes.,olives and mushrooms. Loved both of these dishes as they were extremely tasty and full  of flavor. Sea bass was our top choice. They also provided us with a free dessert for our annivesary, the angelfood cheese sandwich. We usually sway towards chocolate for desserts but wanted to try something different.  Best non chocolate  dessert  we ever had. Definitely  was worth the two hour drive to get here.

She said she's never been in a store where she's felt so unwelcome.

The sales attendant - who she later found out is the OWNER - never measured her foot. Never asked her about her running history or habits. Never smiled nor any other greeting. After wandering the store - where she was one of only 2 customers - she finally brought him a shoe and said she thought this might be a good one for her. His response, ""what size do you want?""  Brought it out, handed it over, rang her up. And she was out.  After the 2nd day wearing, they felt awful. She came back into the store and luckily he didn't give her any trouble returning them (maybe because she brought her 6'6 son with her!).   In fact, she said it looked like he couldn't care less that she returned them.

I would run far, far away from Run AZ.","2","3","2","3","2","2","3","2","1","2"

We didn't wait too long for drinks but our food took awhile to get, our party organizer said she told them to have food ready for us at 6:30 when we arrived but it wasn't. Then when food started coming out, there was no room on the table, there was so much, some tables hardly got anything so we shared as much as we could. The staff was polite and apologetic and tried their best to keep us happy. The food was good, I felt like the pork and steak were the way to go, chicken was dry. House Margarita's were good too.

We tried the pork bellies and grits as an appetizer. Amazing! Very creative dessert menu! The best was that our server Les took us back through the kitchen to see the smoker.

What I did find appaling was comments and discussion between a hairstylist beside me and her client regarding how undesirable it is is to be in Mississauga because there are too many of ""them"" there. Walmart is apparently particularly horrible because of the way ""they"" shop. According to her client ""some fo the canadian ones aren't too bad, but you don't want too many around"". The stylist has brown hair just past shoulder length and is average height for a woman. I am not sure if this is deemed either professional or appropriate salon conversation but it left me feeling sick and disappointed by my experience.

Service is not very good here. Waited so long for everything.

As I am writing this, I've been here for over an hour and still eating. The table beside us got here after us, order before us and got their meals before us. They left the restaurant 10 minutes ago.  It's also really difficult to flag anyone down. We just gave up.

The food is good but I noticed that they don't include as much complimentary ban chan like they did in the past and the quality has gone down - they don't include as much meat in the dishes as before.  I feel like they're charging more and offering less.

Admission is free and it's BYOB, i.e. bring your own blanket. They screen a nice variety of classic films new and old.

There are also more recent ""classics"" showing later on in the summer (e.g. Moonrise Kingdom). Before the main film there are typically a couple of shorts by local Canadian filmmakers.

Showtime is each Sunday evening at sunset, but festivities begin a few hours before this with groups of friends, couples and solos claiming their spots and picnicking on the hill.

This has some of the Best Pizza I've had here in AZ. I'm a native so trust me, ive tried other places. We get the thin crust and ask for it well done since recently learning ""well done"" means they keep it in the oven for a couple min longer and the crust gets crispier.

The chicken was freaking amazing!!! I talked about it till the next day to my wife. I usually don't venture out into trying new things but man, it was phenomenal and glad I did. The Buffalo chicken pizza is another I would recommend, since it a favorite of mine. I have had other dishes and have never been let down by the quality of the food.

If you are looking for a bigger variety, I think that North York location has more to offer. I was surprised how expensive the food is here. They are really earning on their expensive salad bar, that is just ridiculous how much they charge per gram! It used to be more soups (some Whole Foods has more than 15 soups, this one - only 6 types) but they reduced the number of soups, just so they can add their expensive food to sell by grams. Also, the products are way too overpriced (still better than Noah's though). Just recently I bought few products for baking, few teas, cooking oils, etc.. only then realizing that I paid about $3 extra for each item compared to local health stores. Of course, I ended up returning everything, and it was a good lesson not to shop here again. I am not sure why to shop here, I guess if you live or work in Yorkville (I used to live there) then shopping here is the only option because there are no other grocery stores except another overpriced store Pusateri's and Rabba (that is not even a real grocery store, so this is not an option in any way).","1","2","2","1","1","3","3","1","2","2"

The theme of the shop definitely sets it apart from other sandwich shops with the Firehouse Theme. There's a beautiful mural on the wall (which just so happens to be a Pokémon Go spot). Inside there is ample seating, but typically we take the sandwiches to go.

I'd definitely recommend getting a combo with a medium sandwich or a large sandwich (I like to save half for lunch the next day). With a combo, you can get a bag of chips and a drink on the side. There's also a nice slice of pickle with every sandwich, so that's always a nice surprise!

"pIyaIJdVa_Kl8vebITpIew","Copper Star Coffee","it has, that draw. a staple in Phoenix, Copper Star Coffee. Setting a high standard for quality in coffee and baking this place has built a great reputation.  William T. describes the place as ""Very old school""  I agree, This place keeps its simple and relaxing.

Off 7th Ave, its a cool joint, from the outside its noticeably an old gas station and once your inside you know your in a serious coffee house.

Big time fan (3,1/2stars)  Copper Star Coffee is another pit stop that provides this city with its heartbeat.  These little stop shops gives us a little time in society to see or neighbors up close.  Thank you, you small businesses like Copper Star that keep our city one step ahead of our corporate friends such as one that also has a star in their name

I actually haven't heard of this place until my cousins from California mentioned it. They wanted to try the creme brûlée donut so we drove the distance to try it out; it's something I definitely recommend. The donuts here are very different from any other donut place, which makes it all the more special. I really just wanted to buy everything and pig out at home, but unfortunately that couldn't happen.

I was not really sure about the class, but a friend convinced me to go try it.  I am a gym rat, I admit.  I am usually in the back with the ""big boys"" lifting weights and sweating.  This workout is way more calm, with lighting changes and good tunes playing.  The workout is way less jumping and big movements.   It is a whole body work out and the next day you BURN.  (in a good way)  My abs were sore, my butt was sore and I loved it.

If you havent tried barre, I highly recommend.

I prefer dining on the outside patio to being inside, that's just me.  There've been a number of friends that have visited from Pittsburgh or Denver, this is the spot that I bring each of them.  The Windsor is known for it's local vibe that embraces you the moment that you enter.  Don't let the pub and tavern feel throw you, there is great food here and some fine hand-crafted cocktails as well.  There's also complimentary valet by Desert Parking, hand the guy / girl $2 or $3 dollars, it's worth it.

Windsor Square has strict parking enforcement due to the increased traffic from Upwards Projects restaurants ( Joyride Tacos Central, Federal Pizza, Postino Central, Churn and Windsor.)  I might even go as far as to say that they are re-creating the North-Central business community, in a good way.","2","1","3","2","3","2","2","3","2","3"

After paying at the register, we went to the self serve coffee counter to pour our coffee, only to find a little more than 2 cups of burnt coffee left, we asked if we can get some fresh coffee, the same cashier who took our order began to speak in a loud manner in spanish accent: YOU DON GET REFILLS WITH YOUR BREAKFAST SPECIAL, I stated to her thats fine we will pay you more for fresh coffee, we just need fresh coffee with our breakfast, so we ate our breakfast and dumped our burnt coffee could not drink it so it would not ruin our breakfast, we both had to go next door after all to starbucks just to get fresh coffee, I even informed the starbucks cashier about our experience next door at empire bagels, she said many of her customers have voiced their complaints about rude service from empire bagels, obviously they dont care about my repeat business.","1","1","3","1","3","1","3","2","2","2"
"8omL8tvpc_y3smxByLUn9g","Bonchon Chicken","They really have, in my opinion, the tastiest and crispiest version of Korean fried chicken I have ever had. I always look forward to visiting the location in Sunnyvale, CA when visiting family back home in the Bay. So I was very excited when I first learned this place was coming to Vegas. I've been here several times since they first opened and based off my own experience and seeing the other yelp reviews, I fear that Bonchon may not be around here too much longer if management/ownership doesn't make changes.

The main concern here is the value. As delicious as the chicken is, it has a premium price that doesn't match the product. When they first opened, the drums were almost twice the size of what they are now, making the price a little more reasonable. I suspect the reason for the change to smaller portions was due to the cooking time (twice-fried to give that signature crisp) being very long at first. This led to many earlier complaints, resulting in less repeat customers, the need to save money, the now odd hours/random closings, and shortages of some of the items on the menu (which they shouldn't have anyway), again all affecting repeat business. What makes Bonchon popular worldwide is the chicken, and that should be the focus. Bring back the big drums!","3","2","3","3","3","3","2","3","3","3"

The busy restaurant was packed as always around 7pm; long line forming right into the seats, no space on the coat rack and little elbow room between patrons (collectively -1 star!).

Brushing up on my newly acquired skills of talking to total strangers (courtesy of NYC), I struck conversation with the dude next to me while waiting for the menus. The good man happened to be on a connection flight to New York (from Newfoundland), and let me know he had made this connection JUST so he can have the Golden Panang curry! My companion and I ordered 2 of the Panang, along with the Chicken Coco Milk soup and spring rolls. Needless to say the curry tasted amazing, and for the price, I definitely was not complaining about the portion.

In a nutshell, definitely give Salad King a try. Don't go in a group unless you want to wait or make reservations for the second floor.","1","2","2","1","1","3","3","2","3","3"

It perfectly combined cycling with a challenging upper body workout without feeling like you would die. I really didn't want the 45 minutes to end, but unlike many other cycling classes, I didn't feel the need to complement the class with another workout.  The best part is that the price is just right at $15 a class or ($10 if you are student). Can't wait to be back!","2","3","3","3","2","3","3","2","2","3"

They had to get the tires from another location, so I just left the car. They called me to pick it up and everything was perfect. Although needing to get new tires at the last minute isn't fun for anyone, this was a painless experience.

Apparently you have to get a player's card or else you'll only get 1/4 of the winnings. I was not interested in that nonsense. I was also not interested in standing in line for 30 minutes to sit in a smokey room. People take bingo here seriously - which is awesome, but I don't, so I felt strange.

I have enjoyed a blackened chicken sandwich here as well. It was perfectly cooked when I had it here once; not too thick and not dry as grilled chicken breasts tend to be.  My husband enjoys eating wraps here.  Our waitresses have always been friendly and attentive. A really nice spot for a later weekday lunch for us....comfortable, convenient and satisfying.

If you're visiting Las Vegas leave the black jack table (most likely you're not going to win and if you do you'll give it back) and leave the cirque du soleil shows behind!!!

We all know Jennifer Lopez does it all but man I couldn't believe how entertaining this show was!!! She sang songs from her old goodie Jams to her current including a couple special ones! She interacted with the audience, danced her show away and hit every note and move. At 46 she's never looked better. Her outfits were just as amazing! I was surprised with tickets for my birthday and I couldn't have imagined a better gift/night. I'm glad she's at this venue too because unlike other properties getting in and out of parking is never a hassle at Planet Hollywood.

Btw, I wish they had a JLO store instead of the Britney Spears store still because the little booths for merchandise were too long after the show. Maybe a couple more booths would be beneficial!","2","3","2","3","2","2","3","2","3","3"

They're factory authorized dealer for Stihl,  Husqvarna, and Honda  equipment , which may be more expensive than the lower end of what's available at discount stores, but is a cut above in terms of initial build quality, performance capacity, and durability.   An authorized service center for Stihl and  I think Husqvarna as well, they also have large on-site mower repair shop in outbuilding. Easy to get to on north side of East Indian School Road between  7th and 16th Streets, but occasionally traffic makes it easier to turn in if  approaching from the east/travelling west on Ind. School.  I've had courteous, competent service at time of purchase of a single Stihl trimmer and HONESTY in repair service that kept me from buying a new one of same when I didn't need to.

For quite a while now, Sophi and I have been going to yoga classes and then afterwards popping into Tealish for a karma inducing cuppa chai.  The staff are always so friendly, there are an incredible array of teas to choose from, and I love being able to smell as many as I can before deciding on what tea-mood I happen to be in. Above all, the teas really do make me feel relaxed and well, wholesome.  I really like the new venue too on Queen Street.

Cineworld is the big million screened cinema you were expecting. Come here for blockbusters not for art house cinema. Don't expect the latest French silent film about a cat who's also a plumber to be shown here, expect Toy Story 3 played night and day for 6 months. The upside to this place is that its a bit cheaper than other chains like Odeon. Contrastingly the food is, as always, expensive. (Psst there's a newsagent across the road where you can buy cheap snacks!).

Our dog had a growth in her mouth which we became concerned and asked our neighbor for a vet recommendation and he highly suggested West Hill Animal Clinic. Though it is a bit of a drive we could not be happier with the clinic and our doctor, Dr. Greenway. Being a New Yorker I expect the best service and I sure received it at West Hill. The clinic is very clean, organized, secretaries are very well spoken and know your appointment before you even walk in through the door. Our dog had appointments before the surgery for blood work, which the Dr. followed up once the results were in, and when the surgery was performed our doctor sent us pictures of the surgery and the mass that was removed, which was followed by a phone call explaining every detail of the work done. After the surgery our Dr. called us to make sure that our dog was doing well. Every appointment with our doctor has been very informative and makes you trust that your dog is in good hands. Another reason why we are thrilled about this clinic is the cost of care. Again things in NY are very expensive when it comes to animal care and West Hill is very reasonable for the service you get.

I will recommend this animal clinic to anyone who loves their pet as much as we do.","2","3","3","3","1","1","3","3","3","2"

Capo's isn't just all about the theatrics, the food is actually really good...I'm not sure he would agree in regards to his veal Parmesan, but I enjoyed our ""temptations"" (appetizer) called ""Dino's Deep Fried Ravioli"" with tangy pink sauce.

Most every burger aficionado inhabiting California and Nevada now knows what to expect from an In-N-Out Burger: not a fancy gourmet burger but a great-tasting burger nevertheless, with astoundingly fresh ingredients, including a generous slice of ripe red tomato, crunchy green lettuce, and either a lovely cold and thick slice of White Onion or warm grilled onion ribbons, together with a foundation of nice and creamy Thousand Island Dressing slathered over the base of a soft and supple hamburger bun.  Whether a Double-Double, a Cheeseburger, or a Hamburger, the model is pretty much the same, and each variety of burger is surely enhanced by an order of freshly cut skin-on French Fries.  Liberally add readily available tomato ketchup to both burger and fries, and a memorable dining experience will be close at hand.

That's the way it was the other night when I enjoyed the trifecta of Cheeseburger, Hamburger, and an open-faced paper tray filled with freshly made fries.

Seats were hard.  But who cared?  Associates were very pleasant and accommodating.  My burgers were prepared close to medium rare as sought, and when ready, the food was even brought to our booth.  But inexplicably, although I tendered a ten dollar bill and a five dollar bill to pay the total of $13.78, the receipt received listed cash tendered as $14.97, and change returned as $1.19 instead of the correct amount of $1.22.

The room itself was a bit small, and we had a corner room (usually these are bigger) but that is forgiveable considering the cost of real estate in the area.

There are lots of great restaurants nearby, and the St. Lawrence Market is just around the corner.  It is a nice boutique hotel.  The front desk staff honoured the CAA rate despite the fact that I neglected to bring my membership card.","2","2","3","3","3","2","2","2","3","3"
"GifRhXPlxytoRkhyEWbqjQ","Chelsea's Kitchen","The patio is a great place to sit back and enjoy the beautiful Arizona weather for about 7 months of the year.  Right now, is not one of those months though.  Chelsea's doesn't like to disappoint so there are misters cooling it off.

We went last week and sat inside after the lunch rush was over.  It does get busy due to it's great location, food and service.  Ordered the Chicken Nachitos and a Salad.  The nacho dish is HUGE, you have been warned.

This is one of the reasons that I love the Arcadia 'hood, so much within walking distance!  We drove though, still too hot.

Chelsea, I'll be seeing you soon for another sweet rendezvous...","2","2","3","3","2","3","3","3","2","3"
"1CpDgSzeGxpo5DM9MRZXsQ","URBO","Delicious coffee drinks!!! The menu is typical, but you can tell from the spirit in the atmosphere that they give so much care and attention to each drink then your standard chain store. Great spot to pick up some quick necessities and snack as well. URBO fits in perfectly with the downtown atmosphere and urban vibes of the local Phoenix neighborhood. Craftful, artisan, soulful and true to the spirit coffee drinks establish this place as a worthy local spot, however the wonderful friendly staff whom all seem to take ownership make this place a regular stop for me now. I can tell  each time a drink is sold, a part of their soul goes with it.","3","1","2","2","1","2","2","3","3","2"
